# Frame mode, stage 4: the pin grammar

**Status:** landed 2026-09-20, slices 1-4 (1ebb25a7a records map, 190d1d125 bar popups, ef5da6b11 notifications, 2bf416bab the dock's "auto") and the bar row ("feat(frame): the bar's plate is a join on its band"); what was measured landing each is in §7. Stages 0-3 are in
`frame-one-surface.md` (one surface per screen; the frame paints the dock's plate and, in the
Hug bar style, the bar's plate - 720f815f7 "release: 1.2.0").

## 1. The rule

Everything that can sit against the frame is in one of two states, and one word moves it
between them:

| state | what it looks like | how long it stays |
|---|---|---|
| **fused** | joined to the band on its edge: the band-side corners are filled by the meniscus, the plate is the frame's own material, one outline, one blur | transient: it came out of the band and goes back into it |
| **released** | its own piece of glass a gap off the band, all four corners round, its own border | persistent: it stays until closed |

**Pinned means released. Unpinned means fused.** The transitions are the split's grammar
(`motion-split.md`): releasing is the lift and the cut, fusing back is the landing and the
swallow, and a fused thing that closes *submerges* - it sinks into the band along the edge's
normal while the meniscus closes over it. The physics is `FrameJoin` (a18424982), the painter is
`FrameJoinField` (same commit), and the frame draws every fused plate itself (b730283b5) so the
join is one outline on one surface.

Both states exist for every surface. The defaults below follow how the surface was opened;
Settings > Appearance > Frame gets one row per surface to override the default.

## 2. Per surface

| surface | opened by | default | pin control | on close / unpin |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| bar widget popup | hover (`StyledPopup.hoverHeld`) | fused to the bar's band, grows out of it | clicking the widget while open = `pinnedOpen`, the card releases (lift + cut, the elevation gap appears) | unpin: lands and swallows back, then submerges; hover leaving a fused card: submerges |
| bar widget popup | click (`StyledPopup.pinnedOpen`, tray menus, Docker/Discord plugins) | released, as today | already pinned | close: swallow into the band, submerge |
| notification | arrives (`Notifications.popupList`), emerging from its band | fused to the band on its edge (`*_right`, `*_left`; the centre positions stay released) | a **Pin** button, or a drag away from the band past a threshold: releases it and cancels its timeout - it persists. Unpin (the button, or a drag back that ends nearer the band than the pinned rest) fuses it back and restarts its clock | close (the x) or timeout: a released card lands first, then slides into the band. A drag toward the band is never stopped: the join forms with the approach, past the edge the card goes under, and let go there it slides the rest of the way in and closes. Away from the band the pull is elastic to a limit and springs back short of the threshold |
| dock | reveal at the edge (unpinned) | fused: reveals out of the band and hides back into it | the dock's pin: released, reserves its edge (`DockReservation`) | unpin: lands, fuses; then hides into the band when the pointer leaves |
| bar | always on | Plate style: **Hug** (fused to the hairline band on its edge) while a window is on the monitor's active workspace - the frame is the border around the windows - and **Float** (lifted by the compositor's gap from the band's inner edge, inset from the side bands by the same, corners rounding with the lift) over an empty workspace (`FrameGeometry.barAttachedFor`; the Bar state row / `appearance.frame.bar` "auto"/"attached"/"floating"). Islands follow the same state, each on its own; M3 only floats | `bar togglePin` over IPC (`GlobalStates.barPinned`): pinned is released whatever the workspace holds; unpin returns to the workspace rule | released, the bar reserves its lift as well (the dock's flip rule: once per state change, on the compositor's own animation), so windows make room and the island has its gap on every side; bar popups fuse to the plate's inner edge wherever the lift put it; auto-hide in frame mode is still a split (out of scope, frame-one-surface.md §7) |

Two things the table changes on purpose:

- **The dock's frame option.** Today `appearance.frame.dock` ("attached" / "floating") decides
  the join and the pin decides only reservation; the user's own setup is pinned + attached. The
  grammar makes the pin decide the join, so `appearance.frame.dock` becomes an OVERRIDE with a
  third value: `"auto"` (the grammar: pinned = floating, unpinned = attached), `"attached"` (fused
  even pinned - the current setup, kept), `"floating"` (released even unpinned). Default `"auto"`
  for new configs; an existing `"attached"` keeps meaning attached.
- **The hover popup's click.** Today clicking a hover-opened widget toggles `pinnedOpen` and the
  card stays; nothing moves. Under the grammar that click is the release: the card lifts off the
  band by the elevation margin with the neck cutting - the same motion as the dock's, on the
  card's own `FrameJoin`.

## 3. Mechanics

**Records, many per screen.** `GlobalStates.frameJoins[screen]` holds ONE record (the dock's,
35f43c2b6). It becomes a map keyed by the element: `frameJoins[screen]["dock"]`,
`["barPopup"]`, `["notification:<id>"]`. The record's shape is unchanged (plate in screen
coordinates, radii, gap/neck/bulge, meniscus, colour). `Frame.qml` paints one `FrameJoinField`
per record from a Repeater, each pinned to its edge's strip and taken up from `Qt.callLater` as
now; the blur region is the union of the fields' outlines (one pool of Regions per field; the
outline is only computed for fields that paint, b6081b42a). Publishing stays the element's job:
its window keeps input, content and exclusive zone; its own plate stands down
(`FrameJoin.drawsPlate`) while the frame paints it - exactly the dock's arrangement, generalised.

**Fused geometry.** A fused plate sits ON the band's inner edge (no elevation gap), its band-side
corners are 0 in the region and filled by the meniscus in the paint, its far corners keep their
radius. For the bar popup that is the card at `y = bandEdge` instead of `barThickness +
elevationMargin`; its `openHeight` growing is the plate growing out of the band, which the field
paints at every height. For a notification it is the card's band-side edge on the band; a stack
is a column of drops on the pane, each with its own meniscus.

**Released geometry.** Today's geometry: the elevation gap, four round corners, the element's own
border colour. The element's `FrameJoin` owns the gap/neck through the transition
(`attached: !pinned`, `travel: elevationMargin`); while it is fused-or-moving the frame paints,
once it is free and settled the element may paint itself again (the neck is gone, two disjoint
shapes are two outlines anyway) - the dock keeps the frame painting at rest for the hand-over's
sake (`paintsAtRest`, frame-one-surface.md), and the popups start the same way.

**Submerge.** A new primitive next to the split: the plate's across-size (height for a top/bottom
band, width for a side band) runs to 0 on the fluid's spring (`FluidValue`, a51d12212) while the
plate stays fused, so the field paints the meniscus closing over a shrinking drop until nothing
is left but the band. Opening is the same run in reverse. No fade: a fused thing is never
translucent against the band, it is the band.

**Inputs and hit-testing** are untouched: each window's `mask` follows its own card, as now
(frame-one-surface.md §5).

## 4. Slices, each deployable

1. **Records become a map; the frame paints N fields.** Dock keyed `"dock"`, no visible change.
   Contract: `frameJoins[screen]` is a map; Frame has no single `joinField`.
2. **Bar popup: fused by hover, released by pin.** Card at the band, grows/submerges, `FrameJoin`
   on the card for the release and the landing. Settings row: *Popups opened by hover: fused /
   released*. Verified in the sandbox by a pointer moved onto a bar widget (`hl.dsp.cursor.move`)
   and a 60 fps capture of open, pin, unpin, close.
3. **Notifications: fused by default, Pin button.** Card at the band on its edge, submerge on
   timeout, Pin releases and cancels the timeout, close of a pinned card fuses back and
   submerges. Settings row: *Notifications arrive: fused / released*. Verified with `notify-send`
   in the sandbox (its own bus - deterministic).
4. **Dock: the pin decides the join; `frame.dock` gains `"auto"`.** Migration keeps an existing
   `"attached"`.
5. **Docs**: this file's status, AGENT.md's frame paragraph, motion-split.md §7 (the popup entry
   rewritten: fused-by-default, released on pin), CHANGELOG.

## 5. Not proposed

- Input on the frame surface, or a general compositing layer (frame-one-surface.md §5).
- Bar styles other than Hug joining anything: their plates are islands.
- The launcher, the modes flash, the sidebars: later slices of the same grammar, once popups
  and notifications hold.

## 6. Decisions taken at review (2026-09-20)

1. A **stack** of fused notifications: each card is fused to the band independently - a column
   of drops on the pane, each with its own meniscus.
2. A hover popup **pinned by click** releases: the lift and the cut, the elevation gap appears.
3. The dock's `appearance.frame.dock` defaults to `"auto"` in the shipped config
   (`defaults/config.json`); an existing `"attached"` or `"floating"` keeps its meaning.

## 7. What landing it taught

- **A record is withdrawn under the screen and key it was published under.** A notification
  delegate being destroyed has no list any more (no screen name) and may have no group (no app
  name); a withdrawal that recomputed either was dropped, and the frame kept painting a plate
  with no card in it. Measured twice before the fix (ef5da6b11).
- **A publisher's window has to BE the screen.** The notification popup placed itself inside
  the other surfaces' exclusive zones (`ExclusionMode.Auto`) and its window coordinates began
  40 px below the screen's; the frame painted the plate 40 px above the card. Fused, the popup
  ignores exclusion and takes `FrameGeometry.insets` as its margins.
- **The strip is per key.** A calendar popup is taller than a dock; the frame's pinned strip is
  720 px deep for `barPopup`, 480 for `notification:*`, 160 for the dock, and constant per key
  - a strip that grew with the plate would remake the field every frame.
- **Dragging** (review, rounds 3-4): away from the band the pull is elastic - `tanh` toward
  1.5x the elevation margin - and past the margin it pins. Toward the band the hand is never
  stopped: the record's neck rides the approach (whole at the band), so the meniscus grows as
  the card nears; past the band's edge the card goes under; let go there (a seventh of its
  width in) it slides the rest of the way and closes, let go nearer the band than its pinned
  rest it lands and unpins, otherwise it springs back. On release `FrameJoin.disturb` continues
  the join from the gap AND the neck the hand left, so the landing starts from what was
  already drawn. Unpinning restarts the timeout rather than dismissing.
- **A fusing popup reserves the bar's zone itself** (`roomOn`): the frame's insets count the bar
  only where it is the band, and with the Float style the card sat under the bar's icons.
- **Not driven in the sandbox:** the click that pins (the nested compositor has no
  pointer-button dispatcher). The release and the landing are verified as the fused/released
  geometry pair and by the dock's identical physics; the mid-motion look is the user's review.
- **The bar's row** (decided at review: "pin state + occupancy default"). The bar is always on,
  so its grammar needs a second input besides the pin: the workspace. Fused while the monitor's
  active workspace is empty - the frame is then the whole picture and the bar is its edge - and
  released once a window is there, the plate an island above the tiles; the pin forces released.
  Measured in the sandbox through the published record: pin 0 -> 5 px lift (the sandbox's
  compositor gap) with the side insets and the corner radius riding it, unpin back in three
  samples, a launched window releases, its close fuses back. The band on the bar's edge stays the
  hairline (`bandExtent` no longer returns 0 there; the plate covers it fused, so nothing shows
  twice). The travel is the compositor's outer gap. Holding the exclusive zone through the
  release put the island's bottom edge 1 px above the first window's top (8x crop): sides aligned
  with the window, nothing below - a bar sitting on a window, not an island. Decided at review:
  the released bar reserves its lift as well, by the dock's rule (`splitZoneExtra`: the extra
  flips at the start of a lift and the end of a landing), so the compositor re-tiles once per
  state change on its own animation and the island keeps its gap on every side. Popups were
  driven through a sandbox-only probe (the nested compositor delivers no hover): a hover popup
  fuses to the lifted plate's inner edge (`BarPopupOverlay.barLift`), a pinned one lifts its
  elevation margin off it; all five bar styles captured, the other four unchanged (islands).
- **Auto-hide** (review, live footage): the user's bar hides. Three things followed. The
  band on the bar's edge had become a permanent hairline, so a hidden bar left a straight
  gap-thick line where before only the bezel arcs remained - the band now slides out with
  the plate (`Frame.qml` Band `inset` from the bar's record), as it did when it WAS the
  plate. A fused plate whose inner edge sits AT the band's surface is two surfaces at one
  distance from every row below it, and the meniscus blended them into a strip the width
  of the screen (12 rows, measured) - the bar's neck lets go over the last meniscus of the
  slide (`slideHold` on the record). And the popup's field joined the hairline, not the
  plate: with the band 40 px thick they coincided, with a hairline the popup's plate climbed
  up through the bar to the screen edge (a black arch over the clock; a card hanging from
  nothing once the bar had hidden) - a `barPopup` record now joins the bar plate's inner
  edge (`joinBandEdgeFor`), the overlay reads the same edge off the bar's record
  (`barInner`), and the bar holds while its popup is up (`mustShow`).
- **Where the lift is measured from** (footage, a pointer held on row 0): the released plate
  sits the gap in from the band's INNER edge - as the windows do from the side bands - so the
  content's offset is band + lift and the zone grows by the same; measured from the screen
  edge, a 5 px band had the "released" plate resting straight on the band. And the auto-hide
  reveal strip has to reach the screen edge whatever the lift: begun at the lifted plate it
  left rows 0..gap outside, and a pointer there revealed the bar, fell out of the strip as the
  plate lifted, and hid it again, at 5 Hz. The sandbox did not flap with the same code
  (its default `hoverRegionWidth` is wider than 2) - a control that passes on a different
  setting is not a control.
- **One layer, one alpha** ("change the bar color/opacity to see it"). The frame's paints overlap
  by design - a popup's field fills its band side, which is the bar's plate the bar's own field
  paints too, and a fused plate reaches two rows into its band so a lift's first pixels stay
  seamless - and with a translucent frame colour every overlap doubled: the bar under an open
  popup read 22 where the popup read 37. Painted straight onto the surface there is no seamless
  translucent join between two shapes: an overlap darkens, a gap or an abutting antialiased edge
  lightens. So while the colour is translucent the bands and the fields paint OPAQUE into one
  offscreen layer (`Frame.qml paintLayer`) blended once at the colour's alpha; overlaps heal and
  a neighbour covers an edge's ramp. Measured after: both plates 37/28/28 across the junction,
  what is left lighter under the bar is its own widget-group pills. Cost: a screen-sized layer
  per frame surface, re-rendered while a join moves; a record's own alpha is not honoured inside
  it (a floating pill the frame paints at rest takes the frame's alpha).
- **Auto, the other way round; the shadow; the styles** (review of the live build). "Bar is set
  to hug but floats when there are windows - auto should be the opposite": with windows the
  frame is their border and the bar hugs it, over an empty workspace the bar is an island -
  `barAttachedFor` turned. The bar's own drop shadow lives in the bar's window, above the frame's
  surface, and fell across the frame's plate and the fused popup below it - the rest of the seam;
  it stands down with the plate. And Hug and Float are STATES now, not styles: in frame mode
  (the starter going forward; the older layouts are on their way out) the Bar style row offers
  Plate, Islands and M3, a Bar state row beside it picks Auto / Hug / Float (moved here from
  Appearance > Frame), Islands (2) is out of the row until its rework, Float (1) reads as the
  plate. The Islands style follows the same state.
- **Islands are pieces of the plate** (footage: "attaching does nothing to the space they're
  supposed to save, there's no meniscus, the corner islands should be attached to both
  corners"). A first cut moved the islands on a tween and left the zone alone. Now each island
  rides the bar's own join: Bar.qml publishes one record per populated island
  (`"barIsland:<section>"`) with the join's gap and neck, the frame paints them fused to the
  band with their meniscus or lifted off it, the bar's islands stand down (`Island.onFrame`),
  and in frame mode the Islands style takes the plate's height and zone
  (`Appearance.sizes.frameIslands`) so hugging reclaims the gap and floating grows the zone as
  the plate does. Hugging, the outer islands hug their corner too - the left runs from the
  screen's left edge, the right to the right edge, the corner on the side square, the Hug
  fillet under it (the plate's `roundDecorators`, each only under a populated island) - and the
  inner corners stay round; a band-side or side corner rounds with the lift like the plate's.
  Popups: a hover popup fuses to its section's island (`FrameGeometry.popupsJoinBar`), the card
  is the drop as on the plate, its record names the section so the frame joins it to that
  island's edge (`joinBandEdgeFor`), and the overlay reads that island's edge for the card's
  place. Found on the way: the neck's auto-hide fade was measured against the meniscus (49 px)
  and a plate at rest reaches only 38 past its band, so the neck sat at 0.77 at rest - the fade
  is sixteen rows now (`slideHoldReach`), a dozen being the strip it exists for.
- **The pinned strip stays, everywhere.** The popup's field was let follow its own box for one
  commit: inside `paintLayer` it did, on the sandbox's software rasteriser, and on the NVIDIA
  desktop a hover popup sat a lift below the floating bar with rounded corners while its record
  said fused (polled live: popup y 46.9, bar bottom 46.95, neck 1) - the plate painted where the
  ShaderEffect first was. The trap that made the pinned box (frame-one-surface.md stage 2)
  holds inside the layer there; a sandbox pass on llvmpipe is not evidence about it. Every field
  keeps its pinned strip; the popup's starts at the frame's band, so the bar's lift never
  remakes it, and the band-side rows it fills are the bar's plate, healed by the layer.
- **A field paints no band side** (footage: "filling the empty space around it is not a fix").
  The field's band half-plane was painted wherever it lay inside the box - harmless for the dock
  and the bar, whose boxes stop at the band's edge, but a bar popup's box is pinned to the
  FRAME's band while its own band is the bar's plate, so with the bar floating it filled the
  gap between hairline and plate solid, the width of the box. `frame_join.frag` gains
  `bandPaint`: 0 paints only the plate, its reach and the fillets, nothing past the band's
  resting surface (the hump stays - it lies on the plate side); the frame sets it for every
  field (`FrameJoinField.paintBand`), the band being the band's own paint. Rebaked; the JS twin
  carries the same guard. A `.qsb` is cached by URL for the life of the process: a hot reload
  kept the old shader and the sandbox "failed" until its shell was restarted - a shader edit
  needs `qs` restarted, live included.
- **A fused card sits on the flat of its plate.** Clamped to the screen, a card at the bar's end
  ran past a floating plate's rounded corner and its fillet there climbed onto nothing (seen
  live, the right end of the bar). The card's place along the bar is clamped to the stretch of
  its plate's inner edge between the corner radii (`BarPopupOverlay.joinSpan`, taken up with
  `barInner` from the event loop, never bound - the overlay publishes into the map it reads); a
  card wider than that stretch (an island narrower than its card) is centred on it and carries no
  neck, and the span is inset by half a meniscus more so the fillet's own spread stays on the
  flat (the card's edge at the radius still put the fillet on the corner's curve). The span holds
  in BOTH states: clamped only while fused, the pin's click sent the card back to the screen's
  clamp as it lifted - a 36 px slide along the bar in the footage, the still-forming neck hanging
  past the corner for those frames - and the landing slid it back. The card is placed again when
  the plate moves or its state turns.
- **A released card lands first, then submerges** (footage: the Privacy card, pinned then
  dismissed by a click away). Three things were wrong at once. The landing and the collapse ran
  together, so the card shrank while still coming down and never read as fusing back - `beginExit`
  now turns the join attached and holds the collapse until the gap is closed and the neck whole
  (`landing`, then `submerge()`; not until the spring stops ringing, which took 670 ms for the
  last tenth of a pixel). `retarget()` writes `openProgress` to 1 - the opening's write - and the
  Privacy card, content-driven, re-targets as its controls collapse on unpin; under the submerge
  that re-opened the card and the exit timer removed it whole, so `retarget()` returns under a
  submerge (it may still follow the content while landing - the collapse and the landing are one
  motion there), and a content-driven retarget runs from the event loop, after the layout has
  settled. And a collapsed card kept a whole neck: a stalk hung under the bar until the timer ran
  out - the fillets are now as tall as the card (the neck scales with its height, squared), and a
  card under 3 px publishes nothing. Last, a content-driven card's width Behavior is off while
  the content drives it, and the Privacy card dismissed mid-collapse had its width snap to the
  parked square while its height still shrank - a thin drip under the bar; on the way out the
  card is the shell's again and its width and place animate (`card.followsContent`). Measuring
  this in the sandbox: `grim` is a screencast, so every frame grabbed flipped the Privacy card's
  "Screen" section on and off - the card's own layout is stable; the tool was the flapper.
- **Frame by frame** ("a strange shakiness"): traced with a `FrameAnimation` logging the card's
  x/y/w/h, progress, lift and neck through the dismiss, no grim. Three things were not smooth.
  A content-driven retarget deferred to the event loop put the card's edge one frame behind
  its collapsing content (a shimmer) - the follow is same-tick again, the deferral having been
  aimed at grim's flapping. The Privacy card's "Granted permissions" reveal flipped `visible`
  at the end of its collapse and the column's spacing above it went in one step - 10 px in one
  frame among 2 px frames; the reveal is never hidden now and its top margin cancels the spacing
  as it closes, so the column's height is continuous. And the width Behavior, gated off only
  while the content drove the card, restarted from every frame's write through the landing and
  never left 384 until the submerge; the card follows its content through the landing and the
  Behaviors take over only for the submerge (`card.followsContent`). After: every channel
  decelerates together through the landing (dx 4→0, dw -8→0, dh -10→-2), then the tier's
  collapse. What remains is the tier's own start - the submerge accelerates from rest.
- **The contents ride the landing** (footage, the Discord card - click-opened, released): the
  sections' gate (`opening`) was `!exiting`, so at the first frame of a released card's exit the
  contents left and an empty plate landed and sank. A landing card is still open to its
  contents; they leave with the submerge. That was half of it: the Docker and Discord cards
  live in a `Loader { active: popupOpen }` with `pinnedOpen: true`, and the click that closed
  them unloaded the popup - content destroyed at the first frame of the exit, however the
  overlay gated it. Now the popup asks to close (`pinnedOpen: root.popupOpen`) and the Loader
  stays active until the overlay has released the content after the exit (`StyledPopup.held`,
  set at the claim, cleared at `aboutToRelease`).
- **The outgoing content holds still** (footage: weather to calendar, "choppy UI elements from
  the widget the user is moving from"). On a takeover the leaving tree stayed centred in the
  content slot, which is already the ARRIVING tree's settled box: a taller outgoing tree showed
  its middle band the moment the slot shrank - header cut away, the rows below it jumping to the
  top, the clip then walking over them. The leaving tree is re-parented to the host and pinned
  to its top-left for the fade, so it keeps the top the user was reading and the card's edge
  covers it from below and from the right. Not chosen: holding the leaving picture at its screen
  position outside the card (it would paint past the plate's body as the card shrinks - the
  clip is load-bearing), or a snapshot (`grabToImage`) of it, which costs a readback per
  takeover for the same picture.
- **The height morphs across a takeover** (footage: "flickering/flashing when moving between
  widget popups"). The card's open height was assigned at retarget, so a shorter popup taking
  over lost the card's bottom third in one frame (weather to calendar: 324 to 216 with no frame
  between, traced) and the blur behind that band snapped away with it - the flash. A Behavior on
  `openHeight` on the width's tier, enabled only while an outgoing tree is up: an entrance keeps
  its unroll from the parked square (no outgoing tree there), a content-driven card keeps
  following, the exit's collapse rides the driver. Traced after: x, width and height run the
  same curve together (431 to 216 over the tier). `morphing` counts it, so the focus grab still
  waits for the card to settle.
- The bar popup's open and close keep their `openProgress` curve for now; the plate's growth out
  of the band and its submerge are that curve applied to a fused card (rest height 0). Moving
  the card's own scalar onto the fluid spring is a separate decision.
- **The tab** (sandbox, Resources alone on the right island; the Privacy card on a corner
  island live): an island narrower than its card. The card had been centred on the island's
  flat and carried no neck (fillets past the island's ends would climb onto nothing), which
  left a pill resting on a card with a notch under each of the island's corners, and 13 px of
  island past the card's edge on the outer side. Now the island stands on the card as a tab:
  the card lines up flush with a corner island's outer edge (centred under the centre one,
  bounded by the screen), and every corner where the two meet squares off - the island's
  away-from-band corners (Bar.qml's records, by `GlobalStates.barPopupTab`) and the card's
  corner under the island's edge (the overlay's record) - so the pair is one silhouette. The
  hold is per corner and from geometry alone: whole while the card is fused and grown, and
  for each corner by how far the card still runs past it (flush or beyond square, a
  window-rounding short round again). A first cut held every corner on `cardOverhangs`, and
  the exit - which collapses the card's width toward its widget while it sinks - left the
  island's corners square over nothing until the card was gone (burst). The hold travels on
  its own property, never on the join records: the bar's records read it and the overlay
  reads the bar's records, and a value on the records would be a loop.
- **An island the frame paints stands its own blur region down** (the same sandbox shot,
  measured by pixel): the bar window kept its rounded island region up while the frame
  painted the island, so the island's body was blurred twice and read a shade lighter than a
  square corner the frame painted outside that rounded region - the dock and the bar's plate
  already gate theirs on `drawsPlate` / `plateOnFrame`; the islands now gate on `onFrame`.
- **Notification room in the Islands style**: `roomOn` read the released bar's zone from the
  plate record only; in the Islands style there is none, so a floating island's lift went
  uncounted and a card sat under it. Any island record carries the same `zoneExtra`.
- **The released border**: every plate the frame paints had lost the 1 px border its own
  Rectangle drew - the pinned popup card, the floating bar plate and islands, the floating
  dock - because the field paints a flat silhouette and the Rectangle stands down whenever the
  field paints (paintsAtRest). The field now draws a stroke along the plate's free outline
  (`strokeWidth`, `strokeColor` on the record, frame_join.frag): the coverage between the
  outline and the outline moved the width inward, on the free side of the band only, so a
  fused plate's outline stays the band's. The width follows the lift (0 fused, the standard
  1 px released); a distance field covers a fractional width fractionally, so the border fades
  in with the lift where a Rectangle's border would have popped at 1. Notifications carry
  none - their card never had one. In the translucent layer the stroke's colour is made
  solid like the fill's and takes the frame's alpha once, with the rest of the paint.
