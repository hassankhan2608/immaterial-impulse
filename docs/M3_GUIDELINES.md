# Material 3 & M3 Expressive UI Guidelines

This document establishes the strict rules for developing UI components in `Immaterial Impulse` to ensure they fully conform to the Material 3 (M3) and M3 Expressive design standards. 

These guidelines are **hard constraints** for all future UI work. Ad hoc values ("whatever looks right") are strictly prohibited.

> File paths in this document (`modules/...`, `services/...`, `Appearance.qml`, etc.) are relative to the theme root `dots/.config/quickshell/imi/`.

## 1. Design Tokens and Theming

All UI components must exclusively use design tokens defined in `modules/common/Appearance.qml`. Hardcoding colors, radii, font sizes, or animation parameters is strictly forbidden.

### Colors and Layering
The shell uses dynamic, tonal color palettes derived from the wallpaper or theme. 

- **UI Colors (`Appearance.colors`)**: Always use these role-based colors rather than the raw `m3colors` palettes when styling UI surfaces, text, and borders.
  - `colLayer0`: The **outermost** background of a standalone floating surface (e.g., a popup, toast, or OSD with nothing behind it). This token correctly applies `backgroundTransparency` and achieves compositor blur.
  - `colLayer1` through `colLayer4`: Backgrounds for cards or elements **nested inside an already-opaque parent surface** (e.g., a list item inside a sidebar that already has `colLayer0`). These use `contentTransparency`. *Do not use these for standalone popups, as they will render with unblurred transparency.*
- **Text and Icons**: Use `colOnLayer0`, `colOnLayer1`, `colOnSurface`, `colSubtext`, etc., ensuring contrast is maintained across dark/light modes.
- **Primary/Secondary/Tertiary**: Use `colPrimary`, `colSecondary`, `colTertiary` (and their respective `Hover` / `Active` variants) for interactive or accented elements.
### Borders and Outlines
Visible borders are not required for every surface. Many components rely entirely on elevation shadows or tonal contrast (e.g., `GroupedList` relies purely on `colLayer1` against the background without a border). When borders are used, adhere to the following strict conventions:

- **Border Width**: 
  - Use `border.width: Appearance.borderWidth.standard` (1px) for standard structural outlines (e.g., `AboutCard`, `BarIsland`, `StyledPopup`, `StyledSwitch`).
  - Use `border.width: Appearance.borderWidth.emphasis` (2px) to emphasize active/selected states (e.g., `StyledRadioButton`, `ColorSelectionArray`, `GroupButton`, `MonitorRect` when dragged).
  - Use `border.width: Appearance.borderWidth.heavy` (4px) for a deliberately thick accent border (e.g., a clock hand, a strongly-targeted region).
  - Border widths are the one scale not restricted to multiples of 4 - the tokens are `1`, `2`, `4`. *Never* use fractional or ad hoc border widths (e.g., `1.5`), and never re-type `1`/`2`/`4` as a raw number.

- **Border Colors**:
  - `colLayer0Border`: The standard 1px outline for standalone floating surfaces and prominent containers. Often combined with `StyledRectangularShadow` (as seen in `StyledPopup`).
  - `colOutline`: Used for high-contrast interior dividers or form field outlines (e.g., `WindowDialogSeparator`).
  - `colOutlineVariant`: Used for subtle dividers or secondary structural boundaries (e.g., `DockSeparator`, `SecondaryTabBar`).
  - `colError`: Used for semantic error states (e.g., high usage in `ResourceCard`).

- **Combining with Shadows**:
  - Standalone popups and floating elements (like `StyledPopup`, `Toolbar`) combine `StyledRectangularShadow` with a 1px `colLayer0Border` to clearly define edges against complex backgrounds.
  - Interiors and nested menus (e.g., `GroupedList`) drop the border and shadow entirely in favor of tonal contrast (`colLayer1`+).

### Grouped Settings

- Use the standard `GroupedList` presentation when rows are related but remain visually distinct.
  This is enforced: `tests/lint_hand_rolled_row_group.py` fails on rows of a `DialogListItem`-rooted
  type wrapped in a list inside a rectangle. It exists because the phone roster was built that way
  anyway, with this line already on the page. A group whose rows come from a model uses
  `GroupedList`'s `model` and `rowDelegate` rather than a list view of its own; a row that paints
  its own background is handed the plate's corners, because a plate cannot show through an opaque
  row - and `clip` will not save it, since `clip` on a `Rectangle` clips to the bounding box and
  not to the radius.
- Use `GroupedList { cohesive: true }` when every row belongs to one continuous form or semantic
  unit. Cohesive groups have no gaps or rounded internal seams; only the outside corners are rounded.
- Let `GroupedList` provide the common content inset. Child controls must not add another horizontal
  inset that makes icons, labels, or fields drift out of alignment with adjacent rows.

### Dialogs

`WindowDialog` is the only dialog card in this shell and its numbers are rules, not defaults.

- **Content padding is `WindowDialog.contentPadding`, and it is `Appearance.spacing.space400` (32).**
  It is one property because two things derive from it - the content column's `margins` and the
  card's `implicitHeight` - and they used to be two separate spellings of the card's corner radius,
  which made the padding 23px for a reason that was not a spacing reason at all. Anything that
  bleeds out to the card's edge (a `WindowDialogSeparator`, a full-width list, a progress bar)
  cancels *that* property, never `Appearance.rounding.large`.
- **32 is deliberately one step above M3's 24dp basic-dialog padding.** It is a maintainer decision,
  taken because `space300` is a single pixel away from the value it replaces. Do not restore 24.
- **The confirming action carries a filled container; the dismissing action is then outlined.**
  A dialog whose actions are all flat stays flat - the pairing is between a filled button and its
  partner, not a decoration every Cancel gets. The rule is derived by `WindowDialogButtonRow` from
  whether one of its children is filled, and applied by `DialogButton.outlined`; a call site must
  not spell it for itself. The outline is `colOutline` at `borderWidth.standard`, never
  `colOutlineVariant` - a dialog action's edge is what makes it read as pressable, and the variant
  is this document's *subtle* boundary tone.
- **Actions sit `Appearance.spacing.space100` (8) apart**, which is M3's dialog-action gap. Judge
  that gap between the buttons' *drawn* edges: a flat button's painted extent is its label, an
  outlined or filled one's is its container, so the same `spacing` reads very differently either
  side of adding an outline.

### Corner Rounding (Radii)
Always use predefined rounding values from `Appearance.rounding`. Never use hardcoded pixel values (e.g., `radius: 12`) or arbitrary maximum values (e.g., `radius: 9999`).

- `unsharpen` (2px) / `unsharpenslight` (4px) / `unsharpenmore` (6px): Extremely subtle rounding for small, nearly square elements.
- `verysmall` (8px): Tooltips, small indicators.
- `small` (12px): Small chips, standard buttons.
- `normal` (17px): Standard cards, list items, menus.
- `large` (23px) / `windowRounding` (18px): Large standalone widgets, floating windows.
- `verylarge` (30px): Prominent dialogs, major distinct UI blocks.
- `full` (9999px): Circular elements, full-bleed pills, FABs.

Three rungs carry a second, Material-3-spelled name, because the vendored design system under
`modules/common/plugins/designsystem` speaks the M3 shape-scale dialect (its `ExpressiveTokens`
exposes `Appearance.rounding` as `shape`). They are aliases, not extra values - a tier with two
names cannot disagree with itself, the way a tier with two numbers eventually does:

- `button` = `small` (12px).
- `card` = `normal` (17px).
- `extraLarge` = `verylarge` (30px) - M3 calls its top non-`full` tier "extra large".

Prefer the ladder's own name in new mainline code; the aliases exist so the vendored library's call
sites resolve. All three were read for the whole life of that port without being declared, which
renders as a 0 radius (or a NaN, where the call site does arithmetic on it) rather than as an
error - `tests/lint_appearance_tokens.py` now fails the suite on an undeclared token, and
`tests/tst_spacing_scale.qml` pins both the ladder and the three aliases.

A radius that is deliberately *computed* from a parent's radius (e.g. a child nested inside a
rounded parent, sized to the parent's radius minus its inset so the corners nest correctly) is not
a violation of this rule - keep the computed expression rather than snapping it to a token.

### Spacing

Always use predefined values from `Appearance.spacing` for `spacing`, `padding`, and margin
properties. Never hardcode pixel gaps (e.g., `spacing: 12`). The canonical Material 3 system scale
is `0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32, 36, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72`, exposed as `space0`,
`space25`, `space50`, `space75`, `space100`, `space125`, `space150`, `space175`, `space200`,
`space250`, `space300`, `space400`, `space450`, `space500`, `space600`, `space700`, `space800`, and
`space900`. `space100` (8px) is the base unit. Prefer multiples of 8 for the main layout rhythm and
the intervening tokens for nested spacing. Snap raw spacing/padding/margin values to this scale.

Use the canonical `spaceNNN` names directly; semantic aliases are intentionally not provided because
they hide the actual spatial relationship. Only genuine large one-off *dimensions* outside the
0-72 range stay literals. Negative offsets use the negated token (for example,
`-Appearance.spacing.space50`).
`tests/lint_spacing.py` (run by `tests/run_tests.sh` / CI) fails on any raw spacing literal in the
token range.

### Dimensions

Element *dimensions* - `implicitWidth`/`implicitHeight`, cell sizes, container heights - are a
different axis from spacing and are deliberately **not** tokenized (there is no natural clustering
to build a scale from, only a long tail of per-widget values). They stay literals, and the lint
does not look at them.

They should still land on the **4dp grid**. When a fixed-height container has to hold
content-sized children, size the children so the total lands on the grid rather than letting the
container grow - see the sidebar's bottom widget group in `AGENT.md`'s design-language section for
a worked example of why growing the container is the expensive choice.

## 2. Motion and Animation

This codebase uses the **M3 Expressive** motion scheme. You must use the component factories in `Appearance.animation` or the explicit curve/duration definitions in `Appearance.animationCurves`. 

Never use raw integer durations (e.g., `duration: 150`), generic QML easing curves (e.g., `Easing.OutCubic`, `Easing.Linear`), or ad hoc bezier curves.

**Take a tier whole.** Naming a tier's `duration` and setting no easing is not half-compliant — it
leaves `easing.type` at Qt's default, which is `Easing.Linear`, the generic curve this section
forbids. Prefer the tier's own `numberAnimation`/`colorAnimation` factory, which carries the
duration, the type and the curve together; write out `<tier>.type` and `<tier>.bezierCurve` beside
the duration only where the factory's `alwaysRunToEnd` would change the behaviour — which means an
animation something calls `start()` on, **not** a `Behavior`. Measured: `QQuickBehavior::write` stops
the animation instance directly, so a `Behavior` reversed mid-flight reads the same value with and
without the flag, while a started animation stopped mid-flight runs on to its target. A `Behavior`
may take any tier's factory. `tests/lint_motion_tier_partial.py` fails the suite on a new partial
take; its per-file register of pre-existing ones is **empty**, so the rule now holds for the whole
tree with no exceptions. Note what that check cannot see: an easing that is *present* but does not
resolve — `easing.type: Easing.BezierSpline` with no `bezierCurve` beside it is measurably
`Easing.Linear` — so an animation naming two different tiers is worth a second look even when the
lint is green. The durations quoted below are the *base* values, before the user's speed
multiplier.

### Speed, and the reduce-motion floor

Every duration in `Appearance.animation` — and every tier of `Appearance.interaction` — is scaled by
`Appearance.animation.multiplier`, the user's speed preference, clamped to a range that stops well
short of the floor. `Appearance.animation.reduceMotion` is a **separate** state that collapses every
one of them to `reduceMotionFloor`. Do not re-derive "motion is off" from the multiplier's value:
accessibility is a declared switch, not the far end of a slider. New motion needs nothing for either
of these as long as it takes its duration from a tier.

### Stagger

A group that arrives in sequence uses `Appearance.animation.staggerRanks()`,
`Appearance.animation.staggerStep` and `Appearance.animation.staggerDelay()` — never `index * <ms>`.
Rank by *visible* position (a hidden member that spends a slot leaves a hole in the middle of the
wave), take the clamp (`index * step` is unbounded and a long list cascades for seconds), and let
the step be a fraction of a catalogued duration rather than a literal. Scale the step and the lead-in
once, at the call site, so a wave collapses to nothing under reduce motion with no second gate.

In practice a container does not call those three itself: it declares a
`modules/common/widgets/StaggerWave.qml`, points it at the item whose children are the members, and
calls `enter()` / `leave()`. That component is where all four rules above are applied, and it is the
only file permitted to call `staggerRanks` — `tests/test_motion_policy_contract.py` fails the suite
on a second one, because a second runner is how the two cascades that predate the policy came to
disagree about both the clamp and the step. A member opts in by declaring `property real appear: 1`
and folding it into its own opacity; `RippleButton` already does.

Prefer the container's own *effective* `visible` as the trigger over the state that opens it. A wave
asked for before the container is on screen ranks every member as hidden, writes nothing, and leaves
the surface blank — `StaggerWave` holds the entrance until the container is visible for exactly that
reason, but a trigger that is already the right one needs no rescuing.

Not every group wants one. A list the user is about to type into — the launcher's results — is a
group whose entrance is latency on the thing being waited for, and one that rebuilds per keystroke
restarts the wave before it finishes. Say why a surface was left alone rather than staggering
everything that happens to be a `Repeater`.

### Swapping content that cannot be interpolated

To make a `url`/`string`/`Component` swap wait for the outgoing content's exit, put a `Behavior` on
that property whose animation ends in a **bare** `PropertyAction {}` — no target, no property, no
value. Inside a `Behavior` that means "apply the pending write here", so the exit runs first and the
entrance runs after. Do not build a state machine with a pending-value field and chained `Timer`s
for this; the wait *is* the animation, so no interval has to be kept in agreement with a duration
declared elsewhere.

### Spatial Moves (Position and Size)
For elements changing position, dimensions, or layout:
- **Default Spatial Move**: `Appearance.animation.elementMove` (500ms, `expressiveDefaultSpatial`). Use for most spatial transitions.
- **Small Spatial Move**: `Appearance.animation.elementMoveSmall` (350ms, `expressiveFastSpatial`). Use for small adjustments or small elements shifting slightly.

### Effects and State Changes (Color, Opacity)
For color fades, opacities, and non-spatial state transitions:
- **Fast Effects**: `Appearance.animation.elementMoveFast` (200ms, `expressiveEffects`).
- **Faster Effects**: `Appearance.animation.elementMoveFaster` (150ms, `expressiveEffects`). Use for
  the smallest, snappiest state changes where even `elementMoveFast` reads as sluggish.

### Entrance and Exit (Emphasized)
When introducing or removing elements from the screen:
- **Entrance**: `Appearance.animation.elementMoveEnter` (`emphasizedDecel`, 400ms).
- **Exit**: `Appearance.animation.elementMoveExit` (`emphasizedAccel`, 200ms).

### Expandable Content

- Content revealed inside a list must animate into and out of the layout; do not toggle `visible`
  directly and make neighboring rows jump.
- Treat expansion and collapse as spatial motion. Animate the container's height with
  `elementMoveEnter` for expansion and `elementMoveExit` for collapse. The slower decelerating
  entrance gives incoming content time to settle, while the faster accelerating exit removes it
  without making the interface feel blocked.
- Pair the spatial transition with an opacity transition using `elementMoveFast`. Clip the animated
  container so partially revealed controls cannot paint or receive input outside its current bounds.
- Keep the item instantiated until its exit animation reaches zero height; hide it only after (or
  whenever) the animated size is zero.
- Indent expandable child content from the leading edge with an existing spacing token while keeping
  the trailing edge aligned with its parent. This gives nested controls a clear hierarchy without
  unnecessarily reducing their usable width.

### Component Entrance and Exit

- When a standalone component is added to or removed from a surface, combine spatial transformation
  with an effects transition so its origin and destination remain legible. A subtle scale transition
  paired with opacity is appropriate for desktop widgets that appear in place.
- Use `elementMoveEnter` for the entrance and `elementMoveExit` for the exit, and drive opacity with
  the *same* duration and easing curve as the scale, not `elementMoveFast`. Scale and opacity are one
  transition, not two independent ones - if opacity finishes on a different schedule than scale, the
  component visibly reaches full opacity while still growing or shrinking, which reads as a hiccup
  rather than a single cohesive motion. Do not destroy the component as soon as its enabled state
  changes: retain it until the exit transition completes, then deactivate it.
- Animate the component's outer presentation container rather than its content. This keeps entrance
  and exit motion independent from live internal updates and interaction animations such as dragging.

## 3. Existing Nonconformances

The following existing widgets contain hardcoded values that violate these strict guidelines. They have been explicitly identified and should be fixed in future PRs (do not copy their implementation for new widgets):

- **Hardcoded Radii**:
  - `radius: 10` in `TargetRegion.qml` and `IconPickerDialog.qml` - a recurring value with no clean
    fit in the current token scale (equidistant between `unsharpenmore` and `small`).
  - `radius: 1` in `ClippedProgressBar.qml` (progress-bar end caps) and `TodoWidget.qml` (a 1px text
    cursor) - deliberately near-zero on already-tiny elements; snapping to `unsharpen` (2px) would
    double their rounding proportionally, so these are left as literals rather than force-fit.
  - (`CliphistImage.qml`'s `GaussianBlur.radius`, `WallpaperSelectorContent.qml`'s
    `FastBlur.radius`, `StyledDropShadow.qml`'s `radius`, and `Config.qml`'s lock-screen blur radius
    option are *blur* radii, a different semantic axis from corner rounding, and are not violations.)
- **Hardcoded Colors**:
  - Hex values (e.g., `#ffffff`, `#000000`, `#605790`) in `DashedBorder.qml`, `RoundCorner.qml`, `SineCookie.qml`, and the `shapes/` directory.
- **Inconsistent Borders/Outlines**:
  - `StyledComboBox` uses a floating popup but lacks the standard 1px `colLayer0Border` outline found on `StyledPopup`.
- **Hardcoded Spacing**:
  - Most `spacing`/`padding`/margin literals matching or closely matching an `Appearance.spacing.*`
    value have been migrated. Values outside that scale (`0`, `1`, `7`, `9`, `11`, `13`, `15`,
    `17`-`19`, `>=21`, and negative offsets used for deliberate overlap/bleed effects) are left as
    literals rather than force-fit onto the nearest token - re-evaluate case by case if a widget is
    touched again, rather than bulk-snapping them.
- **Hardcoded Motion**:
  - Ad hoc integer durations with no matching `Appearance.animation.*` value (e.g. `30`, `40`, `50`,
    `80`, `110`, `120`, `180`, `250`, `900`, `1200`, `1400`ms) and arbitrary easing curves (e.g.,
    `Easing.OutCubic`, `Easing.OutQuad`, `Easing.InQuad`) remain across many widgets - the easing
    *curve shape* in particular was deliberately left untouched during the token migration, since
    swapping curve shape (unlike reusing a matching duration number) is visually perceptible and
    wasn't verified against a running compositor. `StyledSwitch.qml` intentionally keeps a custom
    bezier curve (`[0.42, 1.5, 0.28, 0.95, 1, 1]`, durations `320`/`160`) tuned for its snap feel -
    this is a deliberate exception, not an oversight, and should not be folded into
    `Appearance.animation.*`. `MaterialLoadingIndicator.qml`'s 12000ms spinner rotation is
    real-world physical timing, not M3 motion, and is likewise not a violation.
