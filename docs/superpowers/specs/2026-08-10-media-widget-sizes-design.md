# Media widget sizes, and a resize handle for every grid widget — design

**Status:** implemented. Steps 1-5 (the grid machinery, the grip, `VisualizerCookie` and its
cava input) landed on `main`; steps 6-9 (the three media layouts and the docs) landed on
`feat/media-layouts`.
**Scope:** `modules/common/plugins/` (grid machinery, shapes), the bundled
`nandoroid-media` widget, `docs/widget-grid.md`

**Where §5 met reality.** The 3x2's migration risk did not exist: measured through a `qs -p`
probe, the widget was already exactly `spanX(3) x spanY(2)` = 420x228 before and after adopting
the grid, because the design-system component declares those pixels itself. The 2x2's artwork is
clipped to a circle inside the cookie rather than to the cookie's own outline - masking it with
the rippling outline swallows the motion the outline exists to show. And the 2x1's arc-length
maths was right while its units were not: Qt measures `setLineDash` in pen widths, not path
length, which draws a repeating dashed border instead of one arc (AGENT.md, "Dynamic/data-driven
QML gotchas").

**And the 2x2 was designed wrong here, not implemented wrong.** §5 described it as a cookie with
the title and artist beneath, which is what shipped; the design is the cookie clock's shape with
next and previous where its date badges are. Both §"Settled input" and §5 are corrected below
rather than rewritten, because the two designs are not compatible and the reason is the useful
part. 562cdf815 ("feat(media): rebuild the 2x2 as the cookie clock with next and previous").

Paths are relative to the theme root `dots/.config/quickshell/imi/` unless written repo-relative.

## Problem

The desktop media widget has exactly one size. A widget's span comes from its manifest
(`grid: {cols, rows}`, see `docs/widget-grid.md`), which is a constant — so no placed widget can be
resized, and the media widget does not even declare a grid: it is content-sized, and its "3x2" is
whatever its content happens to measure.

The ask is three sizes for media — the existing large one, a 2x2, and a 2x1 — chosen by dragging a
resize handle. Sizes selectable per placed widget is machinery that does not exist, and it is not
media-specific: `notes`, `user-card` and `image-converter` all declare grids and all have the same
one-size limitation.

## Settled input (do not relitigate)

- **Per-lobe visualizer.** Each cookie lobe is driven by its own frequency band, so the shape
  ripples asymmetrically. Not a uniform pulse.
- **The handle is generic** — it lives in `PluginWidget`, so any grid widget that declares more than
  one span gets it.
- **2x2 is the cookie clock's shape**: album art inside the cookie, visualizer lobes around it, and
  the clock's two date badges replaced by previous and next. No title and no artist — see §5, which
  records why the first version of this line ("title and artist below") was the wrong design.
- **2x1 is exactly the reference**: prev, cookie-shaped play/pause, next. No text and no artwork —
  but progress *is* shown, stroked around the centre button's own outline rather than as a separate
  track. See §5.

## 1. Declaring more than one size

`manifest.grid` gains an optional `sizes` array. The existing `cols`/`rows` stay and become the
default — every current manifest keeps working untouched, which matters because three plugins
already ship one.

```json
"grid": {
  "cols": 3, "rows": 2,
  "sizes": [ { "cols": 3, "rows": 2 }, { "cols": 2, "rows": 2 }, { "cols": 2, "rows": 1 } ]
}
```

Rules:

- `sizes` absent, or holding fewer than two entries → the widget has one size and **shows no
  handle**. This is every existing plugin.
- `cols`/`rows` must appear in `sizes` when `sizes` is present. A default that is not an offered
  size is a manifest bug and the parser rejects the `sizes` list rather than silently resizing
  someone's widget on upgrade.
- Order is the resize order. Dragging moves along this list, so it should read smallest to largest
  or the reverse, not arbitrary.

## 2. Remembering the choice

`PluginState.option(pluginId, key, fallback)` already stores per-plugin values and is written
through `setOption`. The chosen span is one more option under a reserved key, `__gridSize`, stored
as `"<cols>x<rows>"`.

Reserved because plugin options come from the manifest's own `options` array and are surfaced in
settings; this one is host state, not a plugin setting, and must not appear as a toggle. The double
underscore marks it as the host's, and a lint keeps manifests from declaring an option key starting
with `__`.

Resolution order, in `PluginWidget`:

1. `PluginState.option(id, "__gridSize")`, if it parses and is present in `sizes`
2. `manifest.grid.cols/rows`
3. content-sized (the legacy path, unchanged)

A stored size that is no longer offered — the manifest changed under an installed widget — falls
back to the manifest default rather than being honoured. Silently keeping a span the plugin no
longer supports is how a widget ends up laying out into a size its content cannot fill.

## 3. The handle

A grip in the widget's bottom-right corner, visible on hover and while dragging, only when the
widget offers more than one size.

- **Drag** updates a *preview* span live: the nearest offered size to the pointer's current
  distance, measured against `widgetGridSpanX/Y`. The widget resizes as you drag, so the size you
  see is the size you get.
- **Release** commits via `setOption`. **Escape** cancels back to the size at drag start.
- The widget's position is unchanged; it grows right and down from its top-left, which is where the
  drag started. A widget resized past the screen edge is clamped by the existing position
  clamping — no new rule.

`AbstractWidget` already owns drag-to-move with a 12px snap. The resize handle must claim the press
before the move handler sees it, or dragging the corner walks the widget instead of resizing it.

**This is the part with no test coverage.** Nothing about pointer grabs is reachable from
`qmltestrunner`; the *snapping arithmetic* is pure and is extracted so it can be, see §6.

## 4. A cookie whose lobes move independently

`MaterialCookie` builds `RoundedPolygon.star(sides, radius, innerRadius, rounding)` where
`innerRadius` is one scalar for the whole shape. Every lobe is therefore identical, and no amount
of animating that scalar produces a per-band visualizer — it only breathes.

So `shapes/rounded-polygon.js` gains a variant taking **an array of inner radii**, one per lobe,
falling back to the scalar behaviour when handed a number. The existing `star()` keeps its
signature; this is a sibling, not a change to it.

A new `widgets/VisualizerCookie.qml` wraps it:

| Property | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `lobes` | how many lobes, default 12 |
| `levels` | `list<real>` 0..1, one per lobe |
| `baseRadius` | lobe radius at silence (the resting cookie) |
| `reach` | how far a full-level lobe pushes out |

**Bands to lobes.** `CavaService` produces `barCount: 32` and is shared through a refcount, so it is
not reconfigured to 12 — that would change every other visualizer on screen. The widget aggregates:
32 bands fold to 12 lobes by averaging contiguous groups, so lobe 0 is bass and lobe 11 is treble,
travelling around the shape.

**Motion.** Raw cava values jitter at frame rate and would make the outline boil. Each lobe carries
an attack/decay envelope — fast attack so a beat reads immediately, slower decay so the shape
settles rather than flickering. Constants live beside the component, not in `Appearance`: they are
signal smoothing, not design tokens.

**Cost.** The shape is rebuilt per frame while audio plays. `ShapeCanvas` rebuilds already happen
for the cookie clock's rotation, but that animates a transform rather than regenerating geometry.
If per-frame regeneration measures badly, the fallback is to rebuild at a fixed rate (say 30Hz) and
interpolate — decided by measurement, not upfront.

## 5. The three layouts

`nandoroid-media/Widget.qml` becomes a switch on the resolved span, loading one of three layouts.
The existing content moves to `LayoutLarge.qml` unchanged, so the current widget is not a rewrite.

- **3x2 `LayoutLarge.qml`** — today's widget, moved. Adopting the grid pins it to
  `spanX(3) x spanY(2)` = 420x228, where today it is content-sized. **If its natural size is not
  already that, this is a visible change on upgrade** and is the one migration risk here; measure
  before committing to it, and if it differs, the honest fix is to adjust the layout to the span
  rather than to pick a span that flatters the current content.
- **2x2 `LayoutCookie.qml`** — 276x228. **The cookie clock's shape, with next and previous where
  its date badges are.** `VisualizerCookie` filling a square frame centred in the tile, album art
  clipped to a circle inside the lobe valleys, and two circular transport badges at opposite
  corners of that frame: previous in the top-left (the clock's day bubble) and next in the
  bottom-right (its month bubble), each overlapping the cookie's edge. Tap the artwork to
  play/pause.

  **This corrects what this section said first** — "with album art clipped inside it, title and
  artist beneath" — which is what shipped and was the wrong design. The two do not coexist: a text
  block under the cookie is paid for out of the cookie's diameter, and a smaller cookie moves the
  badges off its edge, which is the one relationship being copied. The 3x2 is the size that names
  the track; dropping the text here grew the cookie from ~150px to 204.

  The placement is `cookie_layout.js`, and it is the layout's only testable part: the clock's own
  `implicitSize: 230` and `dateSquareSize: 64` give the badge ratio, the square frame is centred in
  a tile that is 48px wider than it is tall, and `badgeOverlap` names the bite into the cookie's
  edge in pixels so a changed ratio reads as a number rather than as "still positive". Anchoring
  the badges to the *tile's* corners instead drops that bite from 26px to 8px — see AGENT.md,
  "Dynamic/data-driven QML gotchas".
- **2x1 `LayoutCompact.qml`** — 276x108. Prev pill, cookie-shaped play/pause, next pill, centred.

  **The centre button's border is the seek bar.** Playback progress is stroked around the cookie's
  own outline rather than drawn as a separate track, which is what makes this layout read as one
  object instead of three controls with a line under them. There is still no text and no artwork.

  That changes what the shape has to support. A cookie outline is a run of cubic Beziers, so a
  partial stroke needs the path's arc length: sample the cubics once per geometry change to get the
  cumulative length, then stroke with `setLineDash([progress * total, total])`. Length only has to
  be recomputed when the shape changes, which for a static cookie is once.

  The cookie here is a static `MaterialCookie`-shaped path, not the visualizer — at this size a
  rippling outline would fight the progress it is also carrying, and the two would be
  indistinguishable. Both nonetheless stroke a rounded polygon, so the arc-length helper belongs
  beside `rounded-polygon.js` where `VisualizerCookie` can reach it if a future layout wants both.

All three read the same media state, so no new service work.

## 6. Testing

Honest about what is reachable. `qmltestrunner` cannot construct Quickshell types, and nothing about
pointer grabs, shapes or layout is testable here.

**Testable, and therefore extracted deliberately:**

- `gridSizes.js` — parsing `manifest.grid`, validating that the default appears in `sizes`,
  resolving stored → default → content-sized, and rejecting a stored size no longer offered. Pure
  functions over plain objects; a QML `TestCase` drives them.
- The nearest-size snap: given a pointer delta and a list of spans, which span wins. Pure.
- Band aggregation: 32 values to 12 lobes, including the short-array and empty cases that happen
  before cava has produced anything.
- The 2x2's placement (`cookie_layout.js`, `tests/tst_media_cookie_layout.qml`): the square frame
  centred in a non-square tile, the badge's proportion to it, and how far a corner badge overlaps
  the cookie's edge. Pure arithmetic over numbers, and the only part of that layout a test reaches.
- A lint that no manifest declares an option key beginning with `__`.

**Not testable, needs the screen:** the handle claiming the press before drag-to-move, the cookie's
motion, and all three layouts.

## 7. Landing plan

Each step is a commit that leaves the tree working.

1. `gridSizes.js` + its tests. No caller yet.
2. `PluginWidget` resolves a stored size through it. No handle; behaviour unchanged for every
   existing plugin, which is the point at which "nothing regressed" is checkable.
3. The resize handle, gated on more than one offered size.
4. `rounded-polygon.js` per-lobe variant + `VisualizerCookie.qml`, with a static `levels` array. No
   audio yet.
5. Cava aggregation and the envelope.
6. Media manifest declares its three sizes; existing content moves to `LayoutLarge.qml` untouched.
7. `LayoutCookie.qml` (2x2).
8. `LayoutCompact.qml` (2x1).
9. `docs/widget-grid.md` gains the `sizes` contract; AGENT.md gains whatever the implementation
   turns up.

Steps 1-3 are the generic machinery and are worth reviewing before 4-8 exist, since they are what
every other widget inherits.
