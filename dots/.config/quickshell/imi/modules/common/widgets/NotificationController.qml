/**
 * What a notification card is allowed to know about the thing it draws.
 *
 * The shell's own cards were written against services/Notifications.qml end
 * to end - dismissal went through `Notifications.discardNotification` with an
 * id the freedesktop server minted, and the popup half owned a timeout. A
 * phone notification is a public id on a KDE Connect leaf, dismissed on that
 * leaf, carrying a `replyId` and Android action keys. Because there was no
 * seam, the phone grew a second card: 429 lines that re-spelled the same 70px
 * drag threshold, the same 0.3/0.1 neighbour lean and the same dismiss
 * animation, and then drifted (a group of one drew an expand chevron the
 * shell's own card knows to hide).
 *
 * This is that seam, and it is deliberately the OPERATIONS only. It takes
 * whole notification objects rather than ids, so which id a backend dismisses
 * by stays its own business.
 *
 * The defaults here ARE the shell's freedesktop behaviour, so a card that
 * says nothing gets exactly what it had before.
