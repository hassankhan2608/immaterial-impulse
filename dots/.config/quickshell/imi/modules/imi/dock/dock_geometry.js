// Where the dock sits, for each edge it can be put on.
//
// The dock spelled all of this out four times - in Dock.qml's anchors and
// exclusive zone, and again as hand-written topMargin/bottomMargin pairs in
// DockSeparator, DockButton and DockAppButton. Four coordinated edits that
// have to agree is how a mirror drifts; this is the one derivation they read.
//
// Two ideas carry the whole thing:
//
//   INWARD is toward the screen's middle, OUTWARD is toward the edge the dock
//   is on. The dock's margins are asymmetric - an elevation margin inward for
//   the drop shadow, the compositor's gap outward - and naming them by
//   direction rather than by "top" and "bottom" is what makes the flip a
//   state change instead of a rewrite.
//
//   THICKNESS is the dock's size across its own axis: a height at the top and
//   bottom edges, a width at the left and right ones. The arithmetic does not
//   change with the axis, only what it is applied to.

// lift's direction are all one relation asked four different ways.
