/**
 * Drives the grid resize grip with real mouse events, on real `PluginWidget`s.
 *
 * The qmltestrunner suite cannot instantiate the host at all (Quickshell's
 * plugin does not load there), and `tests/test_widget_grip_lock.py` can only
 * grep the bindings. Neither answers the question this feature turns on:
 * whether a press on the corner resizes the widget or *walks* it, since
 * `AbstractWidget`'s drag-to-move is the root MouseArea the grip sits inside.
 * Only real events can, so the widget's position is scored on every gesture,
 * not only its span.
 *
 * Every check is scored on `PluginState`'s stored `__gridSize` and on the
 * widget's own x/y, never on the animated width - a half-finished resize
 * cannot read as a success that way, and there is no Behavior to wait on.
 *
 * Two manifests, because most of the assertions are about what does *not*
 * happen: one offering three spans and one offering a single one. The
 * single-span widget is the control that keeps "nothing moved, nothing
 * resized" from being satisfied by a harness that stopped delivering events -
 * dragging its corner has to move it.
 *
 * Run it against a throwaway config:
 *   XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$(mktemp -d) XDG_STATE_HOME=$(mktemp -d) qs -p WidgetResizeGripRuntimeTest.qml
