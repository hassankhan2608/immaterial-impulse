/*
 * What Edit Mode's desktop looks like, in pixels.
 *
 * The mode is a transform on three siblings of a wlr-layer-shell PanelWindow,
 * and weston implements no layer shell - so the four-sibling arrangement is
 * re-declared here the way ClockDepthProbe re-declares the depth layer's, with
 * the real `EditModeCard`, the real `WidgetCanvas` and the real `edit_mode.js`
 * doing the work. What is re-declared is the arrangement; nothing about the
 * chrome or the lattice is copied, because a copy is a second thing to be wrong
 * and the point here is to score what ships.
 *
 * This half asserts the geometry and saves three frames. The pixels are scored
 * by tests/test_edit_mode_chrome.py: `ItemGrabResult.image` is a QImage and a
 * QImage is not scriptable from QML, so analysis belongs outside - the same
 * split test_card_shadow.py already runs on.
 *
 * The three frames answer the three questions no source check can:
 *
 * - the chrome stands down COMPLETELY on exit. `rest` and `after` must be the
 *   same picture, which is the only check that catches a radius, a shadow or a
 *   matrix left applied to the live desktop. A property assertion cannot: an
 *   inactive Loader and a zeroed radius are what a still-transformed viewport
 *   reports too.
 * - the PICTURE's corner is CUT. There is no rounded clip in QML, so the corner
 *   is made by covering it with the backdrop, and "did the cover land on the
 *   corner" is a question about one pixel. `cornerMarker` is pinned to the
 *   wallpaper viewport's own top-left corner so the answer does not depend on
 *   the picture's content.
 * - ...and a WIDGET's corner is not. The cover sits below the widget canvas, so
 *   a widget the user parked against the desktop's corner overhangs the
 *   rounding instead of losing a bite to it. `cornerWidget` is that widget,
 *   pinned to the canvas's bottom-left corner because that is where this
 *   machine's own store keeps `visualizer` (0,1200 on a 1440-tall screen).
 * - the lattice arrives with the DRAG, not with the mode. Three frames say it:
 *   in the mode at rest there are no lines, mid-drag there are, and the frame
 *   after the drag ends is the same picture as the one before it started.
 * - the lattice is a SUBSTRATE. The desktop widgets arrive as external children
 *   of the canvas, so nothing in WidgetCanvas.qml decides whether they are drawn
 *   over the grid; an opaque widget must hide the lines under it completely.
 * - the chrome KEEPS OFF the bar and the dock. Two opaque bands stand in for
 *   them on the two edges the mode may not draw on, under the chrome rather
 *   than over it, so an overlap paints the toolbar's own colour inside a band
 *   instead of being hidden by it.
 * - the card's edge FALLS OFF its crest. The wallpaper here is flat, so every
 *   level in the band across that edge is the bevel and nothing else - which is
 *   the one place a profile through it can be read without the picture in the
 *   way.
 *
 * The wallpaper is whatever EDIT_MODE_WALLPAPER names, so the same probe serves
 * the synthetic fixture the suite runs and a real photograph a human looks at.
 * No check reads the wallpaper's own pixels.
