/**
 * Drives the `followParallax` opt-out on real `PluginWidget`s.
 *
 * The desktop's widget parallax is the canvas's own `x`/`y` (Background.qml),
 * so every widget on it travels whether or not it wants to. Opting out is a
 * cancellation rather than a smaller offset, and the arithmetic is unit-tested
 * in `tst_parallax.qml` - what needs a real host is the pair of consequences
 * that arithmetic has for a widget's *stored* position:
 *
 *   - the widget must hold its place on screen (canvas.x + widget.x) while the
 *     canvas pans, which nothing but a live tree can show;
 *   - dragging it while the canvas is panned must store where it was PLACED,
 *     not where it was drawn. Storing the drawn coordinate folds the pan into
 *     the saved position, so the widget walks by a whole pan every time it is
 *     moved - and it walks silently, because it looks right until the pan
 *     changes.
 *
 * The following widget is the control throughout: three "it did not move"
 * checks prove nothing if the harness stopped delivering events.
 *
 * The follower's position Behaviors are switched off (`animateXPos`/
 * `animateYPos`) so a score reads a settled coordinate rather than a frame of
 * an animation. The opted-out widget's are deliberately left alone: the host
 * turns them off itself (`animatePosition: followParallax`), and that IS the
 * fix the last block scores. Setting them here would hide it - which is what
 * the first version of this harness did, on both widgets, and it is why the
 * opt-out shipped doing nothing at all on a real desktop.
 *
 * Run it against a throwaway config:
 *   XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$(mktemp -d) XDG_STATE_HOME=$(mktemp -d) qs -p WidgetParallaxOptOutRuntimeTest.qml
