/**
 * Scores a span change as motion rather than as a result.
 *
 * `WidgetResizeGripRuntimeTest.qml` deliberately reads only settled sizes -
 * whether the corner resizes the widget or walks it is a question about where
 * things end up. This harness asks the opposite question, and it is the only
 * one that can tell a working animation from the snap it replaced: it samples
 * the widget's width *while* a span change is in flight and fails if the width
 * was already at its destination.
 *
 * That is precisely the failure a `Behavior` produces when it is handed a
 * target that moves every frame (AGENT.md: the parallax opt-out froze that
 * way). It never ticks, the property jumps to the final value, and every
 * settled-size check in the sibling harness stays green. So both gestures are
 * driven here: a Size row change, which is one discrete write, and a grip drag,
 * which re-previews on every mouse move and hands the host a fresh span object
 * each time.
 *
 * Four further things are scored because none of them are visible from a
 * settled size either:
 *   - the content's span name swaps at the *midpoint* of the move, not at
 *     either end - a widget with a layout per span (media loads a different
 *     file per span) would otherwise pop at the moment the motion exists to
 *     cover;
 *   - the frost surface is the widget's rect on every frame and is the *same*
 *     surface throughout, rather than being destroyed and rebuilt at the
 *     refresh rate by a region list handed to a `Repeater`'s `model`;
 *   - a widget grown at the right-hand screen edge ends up inside the screen,
 *     and its stored position agrees. The clamp runs when the span commits,
 *     when the widget is still the size it is leaving, so an animation that is
 *     measured wrong strands it outside with nothing left running to notice;
 *   - Escape returns the size on a move, not on a snap.
 *
 * Run it against a throwaway config:
 *   XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$(mktemp -d) XDG_STATE_HOME=$(mktemp -d) qs -p WidgetResizeMotionRuntimeTest.qml
