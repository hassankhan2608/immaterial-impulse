"""Edit Mode's desktop, scored in pixels: the shrink, the corner, the substrate.

`EditModeLookProbe.qml` re-declares the mode's four-sibling arrangement under a
headless weston and saves four frames - before the mode, settled in it, held
half way in, and after leaving it. This module scores them. The split is forced
rather than chosen: `ItemGrabResult.image` is a QImage and a QImage is not
scriptable from QML, so the analysis lives outside, the same way
`test_card_shadow.py` runs.

Four things are checked here and nowhere else, because each of them is a
question about pixels that reads as correct in every source file:

- **the chrome stands down completely on exit.** The frame taken before the mode
  was ever entered and the frame taken after leaving it must be the same
  picture. A property assertion cannot say this: an inactive Loader and a zeroed
  radius are exactly what a still-transformed viewport also reports, and a
  radius or a shadow left applied to the live desktop is the failure that
  matters most - it is on screen for the rest of the session.
- **the picture's corner is cut, and a widget's corner is not.** QML has no
  rounded clip, so the corner is made by covering it with the blurred backdrop,
  and whether the cover landed on the corner is a question about one pixel. The
  probe pins an opaque marker to the wallpaper viewport's top-left corner, so
  the answer does not depend on the wallpaper: at rest the card's corner pixel
  IS the marker, in the mode it is not, and a marker's width further down the
  same edge it is again. The cover sits BELOW the widget canvas, so the same
  question asked of a widget must come back the other way - a second opaque
  block is pinned to the canvas's bottom-left corner (where this machine's own
  store keeps `visualizer`) and its corner pixel must survive. That pair is the
  whole of "there shouldn't be any clipping": one of them has to be cut and the
  other has to not be, and a cover at the wrong z reverses exactly one of them.
- **the lattice arrives with the drag rather than with the mode.** Three frames,
  because the failure is a state and not a value: in the mode at rest there are
  no lines, mid-drag there are, and the frame after the drag ends is the same
  picture as the one before it started - which is the only form of "it went away
  again" that a leftover half-faded lattice cannot pass.
- **the lattice is a substrate.** The desktop widgets arrive as external
  children of the canvas, so nothing in `WidgetCanvas.qml` decides whether they
  are drawn over the grid - the order is a consequence of when each Repeater's
  model filled. An opaque widget must hide every line under it.
- **the shrink is concentric, on the frames nobody looks at.** A viewport that
  reserved the drawer's width inside its resting geometry scaled about the
  top-left and slid, and it settled somewhere plausible - which is what let it
  ship. The desktop's position is measured off the drawn marker at half
  progress, not read back out of the function that placed it.
- **the chrome is drawn where its geometry says it is, and outside the desktop
  it frames.** The harness asserts the toolbar's and the tab bar's numbers; this
  finds their bodies in the picture, which is the half that catches a chrome
  item that reports a position and paints somewhere else - or that reports one
  and paints nothing, which is what a toolbar whose content failed to resolve
  looks like from every property.
- **the card's edge is a catch and not a rim.** Whether a boundary reads as
  glass or as a border is a question about the whole perimeter - how wide the
  drawn band is, and whether it is there all the way round - and no measurement
  of any one tone asks it. Three tones that each measured well summed to five
  drawn pixels of piping at one strength round a 3872px card, which is what
  "edit mode's layout having this thick border" named. Note the failure this
  one exists to catch that its neighbour cannot: the notch check passes on a
  card with no edge at all, because a bare ramp has no notch in it.

The fixture is a flat colour so that "is this pixel a grid line" is answerable
at all; the check that the lattice is drawn in the first place is what stops the
substrate check from passing on a frame with no grid in it.

Skips when weston or qs is missing, as in CI.

        The card's edge shipped as three tones - a 4px shade band outside, a 2px
        specular on the edge, a 1px highlight inside - and every one of them was
        defensible on its own. The sum was five drawn pixels of dark-then-bright
        piping at one strength round the whole perimeter of a 3872px card, which
        is a border, which is what "edit mode's layout having this thick border
        is what looked ugly for me" named. No per-tone measurement asks that
        question; this one does, and it asks it in the two terms the complaint is
        actually about - how WIDE the drawn band is, and whether it is there all
        the way round.

        Three assertions, and each fails a different way of getting it wrong:

        - the top carries a real catch, which fails when the edge is deleted
          outright (a bare ramp from the backdrop to the desktop scores 0.0, and
          this file's notch check passes happily on one);
        - the flanks and the bottom stay inside the range the shadow and the
          picture already span, which fails when a rim comes back at any width -
          the old flank departed by 31 where the shadow alone departs by 9;
        - and the band is at most two pixels anywhere, which fails when a tone
          is widened rather than brightened.

        The probe's wallpaper is one flat colour, so every level in the band is
        the edge and nothing else - the only place this profile can be read
        without the picture in the way.

        the real desktop, a notch of up to 70/255 below the lower of the two
        bright bands either side of it. That is what "the glassy border effect
        feels off" was: the eye reads the dark line as the card's edge and the
        bright band as a piping outside it.

        Both of the bands that produced that notch are gone now, so this cannot
