# Regression guard: a wave member's opacity is the wave's channel, and a
# `Behavior on opacity` on the member is a second animation on it.
#
# A component whose root declares `property real appear` is a StaggerWave
# member: the wave assigns `appear = 0` to park it (a snap, deliberately -
# see StaggerWave.park()'s comment) and animates `appear` to 1 to bring it
# in, with the member's opacity riding `appear` - either through the
# member's own fold (RippleButton) or through the binding StaggerEntrance
# installs. A root-level `Behavior on opacity` in the same file intercepts
# every write that binding makes:
#
#  - park()'s snap-to-invisible becomes an on-stage fade-out, so the member
#    is drawn at full strength on the frames the park exists to clear;
#  - the wave's own animation retargets the Behavior every frame, which
#    restarts it every frame (b710ef731's frozen-Behavior shape), so the
#    drawn opacity is pinned near wherever the fade-out left it until
#    `appear` STOPS, and the member lands a whole fade-length after its
#    slot.
#
# That is exactly what the android quick toggles shipped: the tiles' old
# `opacity: 0` + `onCompleted` self-fade was retired in favour of the wave
# (8a0120c2, "feat(motion): objects converge into place from their own
# side, with a landing" - subject kept beside the sha so the pointer
# survives a rebase renumbering it) and the Behavior that had animated it
# was left behind - so on
# every sidebar open the first-ranked tiles read as "visible at all times,
# then the animation begins", measured on the live shell as appear=0 with
# drawn opacity still 1.000 at the open and 0.147 while appear was at 0.955.
#
# Nested `Behavior on opacity` declarations (a ripple overlay, a scroll
# shadow) animate a child's own opacity, not the member's channel, and stay
# free.
#
# Exits non-zero listing offenders. Wired into run_tests.sh / CI.
