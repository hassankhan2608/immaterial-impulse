"""Drives the real polkit prompt and reads its geometry and its feedback back.

`PolkitDialogRuntimeTest.qml` builds the real `PolkitContent` - the real
`WindowDialog`, `WindowDialogButtonRow`, `DialogButton` and `PasswordField` -
and asks it three things no source sweep can answer:

  * **Where the actions land, and how much room the card gives them.** Whether
    the action row sits in the dialog's content box is a `Layout` decision three
    components down. It did not: the row carried a negative `Layout.margins`, so
    the card's four paddings read 23/23/23/15 and the confirming button's right
    edge sat 8px past the password field directly above it. The padding itself
    was 23 because the card's corner is 23px round - two spellings of
    `dialogBackground.radius`, one for the margin and one for the height - so
    the drawn inset is scored against the spacing token rather than against
    itself.
  * **Whether the dismissing action reads as a button.** Cancel was a bare
    label beside a filled OK. It carries an outline now, and the check scores
    that outline's contrast against the card's own fill in channel levels:
    naming an outline role is not the same as being visible on the surface it
    is drawn on (`colOutlineVariant`, the base class's default, measures 32
    against `colOutline`'s 106). The gap between the two actions is scored off
    the drawn boxes for the same reason - giving Cancel a container moves its
    painted edge out by the button's own padding, so the separation the eye
    reads collapsed from 20px to the row's own spacing.
  * **Whether the buttons answer the pointer.** The fill a button shows is
    computed at runtime out of `Appearance`, so "it names a hover colour" is
    not "it changes colour". Both buttons are hovered with real mouse events
    and the change is scored in channel levels, with the other button as the
    control - a pair that both light is a global, not a pointer.
  * **Whether the field masks with the shell's glyphs.** The lock screen draws
    a Material shape per character and the dialog drew system bullets. The
    check counts the shapes after typing, and clicks the field first, because
    the glyph overlay is a `Flickable` over the real field and one that is not
    `enabled: false` eats exactly that click.

Headless weston, on a runtime dir and a session bus of the harness's own. The
polkit LAYER surface is deliberately out of scope: its gate is a read-only
alias onto the agent and a second agent cannot register for a session that
already has one, so nothing here says anything about the compositor's input
region. Skips when weston, qs or dbus-run-session is missing, as in CI.
