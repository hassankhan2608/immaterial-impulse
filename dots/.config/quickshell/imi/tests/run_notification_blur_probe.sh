# Looks at the notification popup's compositor blur, which nothing else can.
#
# The blur is produced by Hyprland from an ext-background-effect region the
# shell publishes, so neither qmltestrunner (Quickshell's plugin does not load
# there - Region cannot even be constructed) nor headless weston (it implements
# no ext-background-effect) can see it. This runs a NESTED Hyprland on its own
# D-Bus session instead, and photographs the result with grim.
#
# NotificationBlurProbe.qml draws a hard checkerboard backdrop and, over it, the
# real NotificationPopup between two controls: a card publishing a region the
# way the bar does, and a card publishing none. The notification cards should
# read like the first and not like the second.
#
# It shoots three times, and the third is the point: the popup times out between
# them, so the layer surface goes down and comes back exactly as it does all day
# on a real desktop. The bug this probe was written for only showed from the
# second popup onward - see NotificationCardsRuntimeTest.qml.
#
# It measures rather than leaving you to squint, because the difference is real
# but small: over the checkerboard, at the default 0.11 background transparency,
# a blurred card's interior varies by ~2/255 along a row and an unblurred one by
# ~25. The two control cards are printed beside each shot as the calibration -
# read the notification number against them, not against an absolute threshold.
# Look at the PNGs too, upscaled with `magick -filter point -resize 300%`.
#
# Usage: tests/run_notification_blur_probe.sh [/tmp/notifblur.png]
