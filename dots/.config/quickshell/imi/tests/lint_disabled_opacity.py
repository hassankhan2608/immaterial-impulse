# Regression guard: the disabled-state dim is applied ONCE, at one layer.
#
# `opacity` composites multiplicatively down the scene graph, so two components
# in the same subtree each expressing "disabled" as `opacity: enabled ? 1 : 0.4`
# do not agree on 0.4 - they produce 0.16. `ConfigSwitch` shipped exactly that:
# its root is a `RippleButton`, which dims the whole control (the switch track
# included, since `StyledSwitch` has no dim of its own), and it then repeated the
# same binding on the icon, the label, the description and all three content
# slots. Disabled rows rendered at roughly a sixth opacity instead of two fifths,
# and the slots disagreed with each other: `trailingContent` had no second
# binding and so landed at 0.4 while `titleContent` and `detailContent` landed at
# 0.16.
#
# The rule: if a component's ROOT type already dims itself on `enabled`, nothing
# inside that component may dim on `enabled` again - not a nested binding, and
# not a nested instance of another self-dimming type.
#
# Exits non-zero listing offenders. Wired into run_tests.sh / CI.

# There are two ways a component says "disabled" now. The literal
# `opacity: enabled ? 1 : 0.4` is the original; a control that adopted the
# shared interaction model instead reads the dim off its driver
# (`interactionMotion.dimOpacity`), and the model resolves the disabled state
# from `enabled` itself. Both are a root-level dim and both must be recognised
# - a detector that only knows the literal quietly stops seeing the adopters,
# and the nested-dim rule below then passes vacuously for every component
# rooted on one.
