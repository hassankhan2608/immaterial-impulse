"""Source contract for the resize/toggle grips honouring the host's lock.

`background.widgetsLocked` used to be the only lock a grip knew about, so a
widget that was locked *per widget* still drew its grip and could still be
resized - the lock held for dragging and not for the one other gesture that
changes the widget's geometry. The grips now read the host's resolved
`interactionLocked`, forwarded through `PluginNode` the same way `screenName`
and `hostColText` are.

None of this is instantiable by the qmltestrunner suite - it needs Quickshell's
layer-shell types and a real `WidgetCanvas` parent - so these are the greppable
pins that run in CI. `WidgetGripLockRuntimeTest.qml` is the behavioural half:
it builds the three real widgets under `qs -p` and drives their grips with
actual mouse events under each lock in turn.

Each assertion below is mutation-checked; the comment on it names the edit it
