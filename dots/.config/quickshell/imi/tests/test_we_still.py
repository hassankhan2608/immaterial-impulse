"""The greeter's still is grabbed off the live surface, not re-rendered.

The SDDM greeter cannot run Wallpaper Engine, so it needs a static image of the
active project. The only image a project ships is the Steam Workshop preview - a
thumbnail, often square and around 1000px - which on a wide display was cropped
to a narrow band and upscaled several times over (#113; measured at 910x910 on
5120x1440).

The first fix rendered a full-size still by launching a second
linux-wallpaperengine. That was wrong in kind: the shell already embeds Wallpaper
Engine in-process (Quickshell.WallpaperEngine / WallpaperEngineSurface), so it
meant loading a second copy of the renderer and libcef, and spending seconds of
GPU, to photograph a frame that was already on screen - and, in window mode, to
do it in a window that stole focus.

The surface is a QQuickItem. The still is grabToImage() on it, which the
wallpaper transition was already doing for its own snapshot.

These pin the properties that would silently regress: that nothing spawns a
renderer, that exactly one output writes the file, and that the grab waits for a
settled frame rather than the first one.
