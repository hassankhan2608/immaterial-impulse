"""Fail if rich text stops being an explicit, reviewed opt-in.

Installed plugin manifests are attacker-controlled, PluginValidator.js
type-checks `manifest.name` and nothing else, and StyledText is how manifest
strings (name, description, author, option labels, icons, placeholders) reach
the screen - so the render site is the only defence against `<img src=...>`
smuggled into a manifest field. The fix used to be applied one render site at
a time and was missed at least five times; the class is closed instead by
StyledText defaulting to Text.PlainText, which makes every future
manifest-field render site safe unless someone deliberately opts out.

That default only holds while three things stay true, none of which errors at
runtime when broken:

  1. Both StyledText definitions (mainline and the plugin design system's
     copy) keep `textFormat: Text.PlainText`.
  2. Every non-PlainText `textFormat:` in the tree is a reviewed opt-in. The
     allowlist below pins file -> expected count; a new rich-text site fails
     here until a reviewer confirms it never renders untrusted strings and
     adds it. Removing one must shrink the allowlist too, so it cannot rot
     into vacuous slack.
  3. ConfigTextArea keeps forcing the Basic Controls style's PlaceholderText
     child to PlainText - that Text lives inside Qt, where StyledText's
     default cannot reach, and PluginOptions feeds it `optionData.placeholder`
     straight from the manifest.
