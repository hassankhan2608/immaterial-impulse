// edge the guide is drawn at, because the line belongs to the OTHER widget),
// which neighbours are close enough across the axis to matter at all, and the
// two-threshold hold - acquire near, release far, both measured against the
// UNSNAPPED shadow position. Everything about the rendered guide needs a real
// canvas `qmltestrunner` cannot construct, so the arithmetic is the part a
