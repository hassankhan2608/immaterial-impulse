"""A surface that animates on its way out is owned by that animation.

Layer-shell forbids window reuse, so a panel whose `visible` follows the flag
that asks for it is destroyed on the frame the flag drops - and anything the
QML was drawing at that moment is simply not drawn. That is the whole reason
the overview had no exit: `rules.lua` turns the compositor's own map animation
off for `quickshell:overview` (a map animation on a screen-sized surface reads
as the desktop lurching), the window went away with the flag, and between the
two there was nothing left to animate at either end.

The repair is one shape, and this file pins it at both of the surfaces that
have it, because the shape is what decays:

**The flag the window follows is NOT the flag the user's gesture sets.** A
second flag stays true through the exit and is cleared by the exit animation's
own `onFinished`. Never a `Timer` at the exit tier's duration:
`modules/imi/wallpaperSelector/WallpaperSelector.qml` was written that way
first, and measured on a 60fps capture the timer fired with a quarter of the
travel left - the last frame drawn was 74.6% of the way out and the next one
had no panel in it. A Behavior's animation starts a frame after the write that
triggers it and an accelerating curve carries most of its distance in its last
frames, so the two ends were never going to line up. An animation's own
`finished` cannot be early or late.

**One scalar drives every channel of the transition.** docs/M3_GUIDELINES.md §2
asks the opacity to finish on the same schedule as the scale; two animations at
two tiers is what makes a component reach full opacity while it is still
growing. The check reads the tier names out of each animation and refuses a
duration taken from one tier with a curve taken from another - a mismatch that
reads perfectly in review, since both halves name a real catalogued tier.
(`lint_motion_tier_partial.py` is the tree-wide rule next door and catches the
other half of this: a duration with no easing at all. The mismatch rule is NOT
tree-wide, deliberately - four animations in the tree take their duration from
the enter tier and their curve from the exit tier by design, branching on
direction inside one declaration, and a tree-wide rule would need a register of
them to say nothing new. These two surfaces animate in one direction per
animation, so here the mismatch has no innocent reading.)

**And a blur region is not part of the card it sits behind.** The compositor
frosts the rectangle whether or not anything is drawn over it, so a region
gated on the open flag arrives an entrance before the card and stays an exit
after it - a frosted ghost with no card in it. The overview's regions follow
the card's own progress instead.

Every sweep asserts it FOUND what it swept for. A regex over QML that matches
nothing reads exactly like a regex over QML that found nothing wrong.
