"""A combo box answers a press the way every other control does - and its
popup stays put while it does.

Both combo boxes drew a colour swap and nothing else for as long as the shell
has had them; the maintainer noticed on 2026-08-30 ("Check the ripple effect
on this UI component in general. Doesn't seem to exist"). They cannot be
RippleButtons - a ComboBox opens its popup on its own release, a delegate
reports the click that chooses a row - so a PassiveRippleSurface sits under
each as its background: a RippleButton whose containment mask holds no area,
so it paints the hover, the ripple and the lift and never sees the press.

The lift is the part that bit back. Applied to the ComboBox ITSELF, the popup
- positioned by mapping through its parent's transform - opened where the
shrunken button was at the instant of release and stayed there ("a strange
displacement of the collapsed menu"). So the Scale goes on the three parts,
each about the control's centre, and the root carries no transform at all.
