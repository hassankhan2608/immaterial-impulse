"""The cava spectrum has one producer, one band contract, and one gate.

Issue #155: `CavaService` declared a reference count, a band count and a
`values` array, and nothing in the tree ever assigned `values` or started a
process. Three widgets read it, three incremented `refCount`, and all of them
rendered nothing - silently, with nothing in the log, while the bands the shell
actually drew came from a `Process` inside `MediaControls` at a different band
count and a different range.

None of that is reachable from a unit test: the QML suite never builds these
widgets and there is no audio server. What *is* checkable is the shape that
made it possible - a reference count with no producer behind it, a band count
that disagrees with the config the process is launched with, and consumers
each carrying their own copy of the range.
