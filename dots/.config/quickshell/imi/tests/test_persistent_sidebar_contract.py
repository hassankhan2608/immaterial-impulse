"""A sidebar's surface stays mapped; the panel is what opens.

Layer-shell forbids window reuse, so a PanelWindow whose `visible` follows the
flag that asks for it is destroyed on every close and rebuilt on every open: a
new render thread, a new GL context, the scene graph built from nothing and
every glyph uploaded again. The shell has ONE GUI thread for all of its
windows. Measured with QSG_RENDER_TIMING on the real session, that thread sat
blocked for 61ms per sidebar open (`blockedForSync=61 ms, polish=0`) - every
window the shell draws frozen for fifteen frames at 240Hz, reported as "a
momentary freeze right before they open". With the window kept mapped and the
slide drawn by `EdgeSlide`, the same gesture blocks it for 1-3ms.

A persistent surface is a surface that can take input and focus while showing
nothing, and both sidebars had a property that was harmless only BECAUSE the
window used to be unmapped when closed. So the shape is four rules, read at
the declaration that maps the surface, and every one of them is a defect one
of these two files has had:

- the PanelWindow declares no `visible:` that reads the open flag (or any
  lifetime flag derived from it); the surface is mapped for the life of the
  shell;
- its `mask:` reads the open flag, so a closed panel is a hole the pointer
  falls through rather than a strip down the screen edge that eats clicks;
- its `WlrLayershell.keyboardFocus:` reads the open flag - the left sidebar's
  was an unconditional OnDemand, which on a mapped surface holds the keyboard;
- it declares an `EdgeSlide`, and the content's `visible:` reads that
  runner's `shown`, not the flag: the flag drops on frame one of the exit.

And `rules.lua` carries `no_anim` for both namespaces, not the slide rules
EdgeSlide replaced: a map animation fires once, at startup, on an empty
surface, and would fire a second time on top of the QML slide whenever a
remap happens.

Every sweep asserts it FOUND what it swept for.
