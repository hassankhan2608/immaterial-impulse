"""Scores a widget's span change as motion rather than as a result.

`WidgetResizeMotionRuntimeTest.qml` builds real `PluginWidget`s on a real
`WidgetCanvas`, changes their span both ways a user can - the Size row's single
write and a live grip drag - and samples the widget's width *while* the change
is in flight. This module is the driver: it stands up a headless weston, points
throwaway XDG dirs at it, and fails the suite on any check the harness reports.

This is the half `test_widget_resize_grip_runtime.py` cannot answer. That
harness reads settled sizes on purpose, so it passes identically whether the
resize is animated or instant - and so would every static check, because a
`Behavior` handed a target that moves every frame compiles fine, never ticks,
and leaves the property snapping to its final value (AGENT.md: that is exactly
how the parallax opt-out shipped inert). A width that is already at its
destination 80ms into a 500ms move is the signature of that bug, and it is what
these checks fail on.

The grip is driven as well as the Size row for the same reason: it re-previews
on every mouse move and hands the host a fresh span object each time, which is
the shape that froze the position Behavior.

Skips when weston or qs is missing, as in CI.
