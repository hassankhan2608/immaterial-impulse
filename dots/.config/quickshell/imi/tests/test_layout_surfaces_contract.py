"""Two widget layouts in one store, and the places that must agree about it.

Spec §4.3 as amended 2026-08-18: the lock screen's widget layout inherits the
desktop's until the first move on the Lockscreen tab forks it. The arithmetic
is `layout_surfaces.js` and `tst_layout_surfaces.qml` drives it bare; the real
drag path is `EditModeRuntimeTest.qml`. What this module pins is the drift that
would be silent between them:

- every position WRITE that can be undone captures the surface at push time -
  a closure that resolved it at pop time writes a lock position into the
  desktop store when the user undoes from the other tab, and the store still
  reads as valid;
- the store carries `lockPositions` beside `desktopPositions` from the empty
  state, through the loader's shape check, and through `presets.sh` in BOTH
  directions - a preset saved by this shell carries the lock layout, and a
  preset from an older shell that lacks the key does not wipe a user's fork
  (the same `has()` shape the desktop map already uses);
- PRESENCE forks under that same rule and in the same file, and the master
  gate stays above it: `lock.showWidgets` is what a user already has set, so
  the per-widget choice is a term beside it rather than a replacement for it;
- the surface a read or write follows by DEFAULT is the one derivation of the
  lock look, so a widget on the Lockscreen tab and a widget under a real lock
  read the same store.

Sweeps assert they FOUND what they swept.
