# Regression guard: a harness that launches `qs` must decide which session bus
# it talks to. One that inherits `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` is not testing the
# shell - it is testing the shell plus whatever the developer happens to be
# running, and the answer changes between their machine and CI.
#
# The failure that bought this check, in full, because it is the exact shape
# the register below is about.
#
# `test_lock_island_reorder_runtime.py` drags the lock screen's left island.
# `LockSurface.islandItemVisible` hides `username` and `keyboardLayout` while a
# media player is registered, so the slots the drag names exist only when
# nothing holds an MPRIS name. The harness already took great care to be
# isolated - its own XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, its own weston, its own config and state
# home, HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE popped so it can never reach the user's
# compositor - and then inherited the session bus, where the maintainer's
# browser was registered as a player. The drag landed on two invisible slots,
# committed nothing, and the check failed. CI never saw it: the runner has no
# player, and it skips this test for want of `qs` anyway.
#
# So the same measurement passed on one machine and failed on another while the
# shell's own code was identical. That is the class AGENT.md records as "a
# measurement needs a control": the variable under test was the reorder, and
# the thing that actually moved was a browser tab.
#
# THE REGISTER, and why it is a ratchet rather than a bulk fix.
#
# Thirty-three harnesses in the tree launch `qs` on the inherited bus. Most
# read nothing off it and are fine today by luck rather than by design, and
# wrapping all of them in one branch means thirty-three unverified changes to
# tests whose whole job is to be trustworthy - `dbus-run-session` starts a bus
# with no services on it at all, so a harness that quietly depended on one
# (UPower, a portal, a notification daemon) would start failing for a new
# reason. They are fixed one at a time, each verified by running it.
#
# EXISTING is therefore the list of harnesses still on the inherited bus, and
# the check fails two ways:
#
#   - a harness outside the register launches `qs` without deciding its bus
#     (new code cannot add one);
#   - a registered harness now decides its bus (fixing one is required to take
#     it OUT of the list, so the register cannot rot into a permanent
#     allowlist nobody rechecks).
#
# "Decides" means either `dbus-run-session` (a private bus with nothing on it)
# or an explicit `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` in the harness's env - pointing at
# a bus the test starts itself is as deliberate as isolating from it, and
# `test_notification_cards_runtime.py` needs exactly that.
#
# It has to be decided AT THE LAUNCH, and the first version of this check did
# not require that: it searched the whole file, so a harness naming
# `dbus-run-session` only in its `shutil.which` availability gate satisfied it
# while launching `qs` bare. Found by planting exactly that - unwrapping one
# converted harness's launch and watching the lint stay green. The argv list
# carrying `qs` must carry the wrapper too, which is a question about one list
# rather than about a file, so `ast` answers it.
#
# Lints are exempt: they read source, they start no shell.
