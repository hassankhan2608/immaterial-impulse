"""A shared widget is presentational. This is the ratchet that keeps it so.

`modules/common/widgets` is a promise: anything in it can be used by any
surface. A widget that reads the user's config, writes global state, talks to a
service or spawns a process breaks that promise silently - it keeps working, and
the next person reaching for it inherits a dependency nobody mentioned.

An audit of the folder found 23 files doing exactly that. Most were not widgets
that grew a brain; they were feature code filed in the wrong folder, and
seventeen of them have since moved out to the module that was their consumer,
been inverted into a property or a signal the host answers, or turned out to
have no consumer at all. What is left is listed below, each with the reason it
is still here - so the list can shrink and cannot quietly grow.

What counts as reaching past presentation:

  - a service singleton (anything under `services/`, except `Translation`,
    which is text and belongs everywhere);
  - `Config.options.*`, read or written. A dumb widget takes what it draws as a
    property; the caller reads the config;
  - `GlobalStates.*`, likewise. A widget that asks whether a particular panel is
    open cannot be used in another one, which is the concrete bug this rule
    prevents;
  - a `Process` or `execDetached`. A component that can run a command is not a
    component.

`Appearance` is deliberately NOT on that list: design tokens are what makes
these widgets consistent, and a widget reading them is the system working.

Comments are stripped before matching. The first version of this scan accused
StaggerWave over the word `GlobalStates` inside a comment explaining why it does
NOT read one.
