"""Source pins holding bar geometry where a unit test can reach it.

`tst_bar_geometry.qml` evaluates the real `Appearance.sizes.*` tokens and
proves the arithmetic. That only guards anything for as long as the call sites
actually *read* those tokens - an inline expression in Bar.qml or in one of the
badges is invisible to it, and inline is exactly where both bugs lived:

  - #98: `margins.bottom` was
        (enable && anchors.bottom) * -1 || cornerStyle === 3 ? 5 : 0
    and `||` binds tighter than `?:`, so the whole left-hand side was only the
    ternary's condition. A live dead-pixel workaround yielded +5 instead of -1.

  - #99: the standalone badges centred themselves in the whole bar, which is
    the group pill's centre only while the pill's two insets match. Hug's stop
    matching, and the badge went flush against one edge of the pill.

So these pins are about *where the arithmetic lives*, not about its result.
They reuse the structural QML reader from the background suppression pins
rather than grepping raw text, for the reason recorded there: a text pattern
over QML decays into one that matches nothing after any reformat.
