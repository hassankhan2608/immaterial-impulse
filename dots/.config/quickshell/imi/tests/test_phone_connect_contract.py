"""Contract checks for services/PhoneConnect.qml.

The QML suite (tst_phone_connect.qml) exercises the parser/normalization
logic through a logic-only double, so the double proving something means
nothing unless the real service carries the same logic. The sync check here
is what makes the double's green transfer: the region between the
`BEGIN/END phone-connect parser logic` markers must be byte-for-byte
identical in both files (the BEGIN line itself may differ - each side points
its "synced with" note at the other).

The rest pins the busctl I/O the double deliberately omits:
- every busctl invocation is an argv array; the only shell string is the
  static `command -v busctl` presence probe, with nothing interpolated;
- device ids are filtered through validDeviceId before they are spliced
  into object paths, and Valent object paths pass validValentObjectPath
  before they are called into;
- the streaming monitor's lifetime, which is the half of this feature that
  cannot be unit tested and the half CONTRIBUTING.md names outright: the
  monitor Process must carry no `running` binding, every restart must go
  through the backoff plan, and the poll must stay on (gated on
  enableService && installed) as the reconcile behind it.
