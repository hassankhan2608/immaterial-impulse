"""Source contract: desktop widgets go opaque when transparency is off.

The bug: opacity and frost were governed by two different settings and only
frost knew about the toggle. `PluginWidget`'s blur `Repeater` is gated on
`Config.options.appearance.transparency.enable`, but every widget's panel alpha
came straight from `Config.options.plugins.blurOpacity` (or a hardcoded 0.1),
which is not. Turning transparency off therefore removed the blur and kept the
10% panel - every desktop widget became a hole onto the sharp wallpaper while
the dock and the settings window correctly went opaque.

The derivation itself is behavioural and lives in `tst_plugin_state.qml`. What
cannot be unit-tested is that every *call site* goes through it: a single
widget left reading `blurOpacity` directly is invisible to that test and stays
see-through on screen. These are the greppable pins for that, plus the two
settings-side halves the fix would silently do nothing without.

The last class widens the file past the plugin widgets. The same shape - a
surface applying its own alpha on top of an already-gated token - turned up in
two more places while auditing this one, and they belong in the same file
rather than a sibling: what a future agent greps for is "who is gated on
`transparency.enable`", and splitting that answer in two is how a two-sided
contract drifts apart (AGENT.md, on the validator/renderer whitelists).

Each assertion names the edit it exists to redden.
