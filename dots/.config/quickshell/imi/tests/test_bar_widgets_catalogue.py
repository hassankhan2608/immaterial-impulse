"""The bar widget catalogue has one home, and the settings page reads it.

BarConfig.qml used to carry the whole catalogue - 21 hardcoded entries plus a
plugin derivation - while the bar itself had none. Edit Mode's stage 8 drawer
is a second consumer, and a second copy of a catalogue is the drift this suite
already reddens on elsewhere (`test_bar_widget_parity.py`: a capability added
to one copy and not the other, silently). So `BarWidgets.qml` is the one list,
and these checks are what stop the settings page growing its own back:

  - BarConfig must READ the singleton (`BarWidgets.available` /
    `BarWidgets.nameFor`) and must not re-derive the plugin half from
    `PluginManager.availablePlugins`;
  - BarConfig must not declare an inline catalogue row (`{ id: "...", ... }`)
    at all - one row is how the second copy starts;
  - every static row in BarWidgets keeps its `Translation.tr("...")` literal,
    because translations/tools/translation-manager.py extracts keys by
    scanning for exactly that call form and its `clean` command deletes keys
    nothing matches - a name held as a bare string would be stripped from
    every language file on the next clean;
  - a plugin's name must NOT go through tr(): a manifest's `name` is the
    author's string, not a translation key;
  - the singleton stays registered where its siblings are (both qmldirs -
    the live one, and the tests mirror spec §11.1 requires before any test
    can see it).

Nothing here reads raw file text: `_qml_source` blanks comments, for the
reason `test_background_fullscreen_suppression.py` records - a comment
mentioning the word being grepped for defeats a raw grep outright.
