"""Drives Edit Mode's desktop with real mouse events, at the mode's own scale.

`EditModeRuntimeTest.qml` builds a real `WidgetCanvas` with real
`PluginWidget`s on it, applies the same transform the background surface
applies - from the same module and the same tokens - and drags widgets around
inside it. This module is the driver: it stands up a headless weston, points
throwaway XDG dirs at it, and fails the suite on any check the harness reports.

`tst_edit_mode.qml` covers the arithmetic and `test_edit_mode_contract.py`
covers what the source says. Neither can answer the question the viewport turns
on: whether a gesture still lands where the pointer put it once the canvas is
drawn at a scale. The drag is hand-computed by mapping the pointer through the
moving widget into the canvas frame, so the transform is meant to cancel itself
out - and the last time that was assumed rather than measured, half a gesture
was being swallowed (d2ebb5aeb).

Headless weston rather than the caller's session because the harness opens a
window. It implements no wlr-layer-shell, so nothing about the background
*surface* is visible from here - the blur backdrop, the keyboard focus the
Escape ladder needs and the compositor's alpha map are all outside what any
harness can say.

Skips when weston or qs is missing, as in CI.
