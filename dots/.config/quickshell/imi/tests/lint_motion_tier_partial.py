# Regression guard: an animation that takes a motion tier's `duration` must
# take an easing with it. Half a tier is silently a generic curve.
#
#   NumberAnimation { duration: Appearance.animation.elementMoveFast.duration }
#
# reads as compliant - it names a token, it has no millisecond literal, and
# `docs/M3_GUIDELINES.md` §2's rule about raw durations is satisfied. It leaves
# `easing.type` at Qt's default, which is `Easing.Linear`: the generic curve
# that same section forbids outright. Nothing about the source shows it, no
# warning is logged, and the QML suite never builds these widgets.
#
# This is a check rather than another note because the note already existed and
# the mistake was made anyway, twice in two days, in code someone was actively
# looking at:
#
#   - 2044e1b3b ("fix(bar): give the util button's expand the curve it names")
#     repaired the two size Behaviors in `modules/imi/bar/UtilButton.qml` and
#     left THREE more partial takes in the same file, on the colour and opacity
#     Behaviors a few lines below. They are still there; they are in this
#     check's register.
#   - 8d81d7471 ("fix(editMode): take the motion tiers whole instead of half of
#     one each") found the resize grip's `Behavior on opacity` doing it, and
#     recorded that every grip in the shell had faded linearly since the file
#     was written.
#
# AGENT.md's design-language section states the rule ("Take a motion tier
# whole, because half of one is silently a generic curve"). A rule that has
# been written down and broken twice is a rule that wants a failing check, not
# a third paragraph.
#
# THE REGISTER, and why it is a ratchet rather than a bulk fix.
#
# The tree carries 40 of these across 17 files. They are not fixed here, for
# the reason `docs/M3_GUIDELINES.md` §3 already gives for the whole class:
# "the easing *curve shape* in particular was deliberately left untouched
# during the token migration, since swapping curve shape (unlike reusing a
# matching duration number) is visually perceptible and wasn't verified against
# a running compositor". Forty unverified visual changes in one branch is worse
# than forty known ones in a register.
#
# So EXISTING holds a count per file, and the check fails three ways:
#
#   - a file outside the register has any partial take (new code cannot add
#     one);
#   - a registered file has MORE than its count (an existing offender may not
#     breed);
#   - a registered file has FEWER than its count (fixing one is required to
#     move the number down, so the register cannot rot into a permanent
#     allowlist that nobody rechecks).
#
# What it does NOT fail on, deliberately:
#
#   - An easing that is present but generic (`easing.type: Easing.OutQuad`).
#     That is the separate, already-registered nonconformance in
#     `docs/M3_GUIDELINES.md` §3, and it is a different failure: the author
#     chose a curve, where this check is about a curve nobody chose.
#   - A duration from one tier beside a curve spelled straight out of
#     `Appearance.animationCurves` (SpanTravel, DockIconMotion and about thirty
#     others). Those pair the tier with its OWN curve today, so they are a
#     drift risk rather than a live defect, and folding them in here would
#     triple the register for no bug.
#   - `PauseAnimation`, `SmoothedAnimation` and `SpringAnimation`, which have
#     no easing curve to take.
#
# Exits non-zero listing offenders. Wired into run_tests.sh / CI.
