"""Source contract: a widget's own options and the host's rows are two groups.

`PluginOptions.qml` used to build one flat model - four synthesized host rows
(`Blur background`, `Lock position`, `Click through`, `Stay translucent`)
`.concat(manifest.options)` in front of whatever the plugin declared. Every
widget's settings page therefore opened with four identical switches, and the
two or three settings the user actually came for sat below them, reading as if
the plugin had declared the switches too.

The split is presentation only, so nothing at runtime notices if a later edit
concatenates the two lists again - the page still renders, just wrong again.
This is the greppable half: the plugin's own options render first and outside
the section, and every host row renders inside a `ContentSubsection` titled
"Widget behaviour".
