"""The polkit prompt is drawn out of the shell's own parts, not Material's.

Two rules, and both are things the shell got wrong once already.

**One password prompt, one control.** The lock screen and the polkit dialog are
the same interaction - a modal surface asking for the user's password - and they
were two different text fields: the lock screen's `ToolbarTextField` (a filled
pill, the shape every field in this shell has) and polkit's `MaterialTextField`,
which hands its container to QtQuick Controls' Material style
(`Material.containerStyle: Material.Outlined`) and draws a boxed outline with the
prompt floating in a notch cut through it. That shape appears nowhere else here.
The check reads the LOCK screen's own field type rather than naming a type in a
string, so the two cannot drift apart by a rename.

They then drifted again in the half a type name does not carry: the lock screen
masked with `PasswordChars` - a Material shape per character, each animating in
as it is typed - and the dialog masked with `echoMode` alone, so one prompt drew
glyphs and the other drew system bullets. The masking lives in `PasswordField`
now, and the sweep below refuses a second copy of the overlay outside
`modules/common/widgets/`: it is five things to get right at a call site (a
transparent glyph colour, a transparent selection pair, the overlay's own
margins, its `enabled: false`, and the config switch), which is how the dialog
came to have none of them.

**Exactly one filled button, and it is the confirming one.** Cancel and OK were
both flat, so the one question a modal authentication prompt has to answer - which
of these two is what you came here to do - had no answer in the picture at all.
`modules/imi/editMode/EditModeChromeContent.qml`'s `doneButton` records the same
failure from the other end and the same fix: a filled container on the primary
role. Two filled buttons reintroduce the problem from the other side, so the
count is pinned as well as the placement.

**And the other half of that pair is stated once.** Filling the confirm answered
the question from one side and left the other one open: a bare label beside a
filled container reads as a link rather than as the second half of a choice,
which is 283ada440 ("fix(editmode): the toolbar's title stops reading as a
button") arriving from the opposite direction. The rule - a dialog whose
confirming action is filled gives its dismissing action an outline, a dialog
whose actions are all flat stays flat - is derived by `WindowDialogButtonRow`
and applied by `DialogButton`, so the next dialog that grows a filled confirm
gets it without anyone remembering to. A call site spelling `outlined:` for
itself is the fourteenth Cancel getting it wrong, so no call site may.

Every sweep asserts it FOUND what it swept for. A regex over QML that matches
nothing reads exactly like a regex over QML that found nothing wrong, and this
file's whole job is to hold a shape that a rewrite would spell differently.
