"""The phone's notification mirror, driven against a fake daemon in a real shell.

`PhoneNotificationsRuntimeTest.qml` runs the real `services/PhoneNotifications.qml`
over the real `services/PhoneConnect.qml`, with a fake `busctl` on PATH
exposing one paired, reachable phone. The fake is stateful: its
`activeNotifications` answers from a file holding one public id, its
`monitor` verb adds a second id to that file and prints one
`notificationPosted` signal line, and its leaf `dismiss` removes the id it
was aimed at. The harness reads the model back - the sweep's one
notification with the leaf's fields and the package, the groups, the dedupe
gate, the SECOND notification arriving from the signal (the oracle for the
trigger chain: PhoneConnect's allowlist, its settle, deviceChangeSettled(),
the refetch - with the reconcile a minute out and PhoneConnect's poll ten
minutes out, nothing else can deliver it), the cache landing in Persistent,
and the local effect of dismiss, reply and dismissAll.

The writes are scored HERE, off the fake's recorded invocations:
- `dismiss` reached the LEAF path (`…/notifications/<id>`) on the leaf
  interface's own `dismiss` method, once for 70 and once for 71 - and never
  as a device-level `sendAction … cancel`;
- `sendReply` reached the device-level interface as the two-string call
  with the notification's reply id, exactly once (the empty reply and the
  reply to a notification with no reply id reached nothing);
- `sendAction` reached the same interface keyed on the internalId;
- the refetch after the reply landed no sooner than the declared 800ms;
- exactly ONE busctl monitor was spawned in the whole run - PhoneConnect's.

A click that reached nothing would leave the harness green (the card goes
either way) and this red.

Brings its own headless weston and its own session bus (`dbus-run-session`).
Skips when weston, qs or dbus-run-session are missing, as in CI.
