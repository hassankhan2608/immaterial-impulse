"""The Phone tab's pages, feature cards and settings page against what the
services and the config schema actually declare.

The rule this exists for is one sentence: **a button whose call no service
answers is a fake action.** `tests/test_phone_connect_contract.py` states it
for the right sidebar's dialog with a hand-written allowlist; the surfaces
here reach five services and a whole config subtree, so the allowlist is
DERIVED - every `PhoneX.member` in the surface is resolved against the
properties, functions and signals `services/PhoneX.qml` declares, and every
`Config.options.phone.*` path against `Config.qml`'s own block.

That is not hypothetical tidiness. The sibling fork's cards offer a phone
screenshot, a phone power toggle and a "hear yourself" loopback; our
PhoneScrcpy and PhoneMic answer none of the three (PhoneMic only ever
*unloads* a `module-loopback`, it never loads one), and the fork's webcam and
microphone pages carry a frame rate, a bitrate and three audio-effect
switches whose keys this schema does not declare - a control bound to an
undeclared key reads `undefined`, takes its fallback for ever, and is
destroyed by the JsonAdapter's first write (AGENT.md, The Config system).
Each of those is one copied block away from shipping.

The rest pins the seams this workstream owns but does not control:

- the pages are rooted on `PhoneSubPage`, which W5a owns and which does not
  exist in this checkout. The interface they are written against lives in a
  local stub under tests/imports/ - never a second copy under modules/, which
  would be exactly the dead-copy hazard lint_no_stale_widget_canvas.py exists
  to fail on;
- `PhoneFeatureCards` announces `openPage(id)` and reads nothing off the tab
  that hosts it;
- every state key phone_cards.js can answer with has an arm at the call site,
  because an unmapped key is a card drawing an empty line;
- the install guide copies through a constant argv, never a shell string.

Static, because none of this is reachable from qmltestrunner: it can build
neither a RippleButton nor a laid-out box. The decisions these files make are
driven by tests/tst_phone_cards.qml.
