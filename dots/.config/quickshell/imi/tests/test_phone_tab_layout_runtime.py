"""What the Phone tab and its sub-pages draw, measured in a real window.

`PhoneTabLayoutRuntimeTest.qml` builds the real tab over the real services,
opens the Contacts and Android Apps sub-pages and reads the drawn geometry
back. It exists because four defects the maintainer hit are invisible to
every other check in this suite:

- a sub-page whose content resolves to ZERO height renders its header and
  nothing else. `PhoneContactsPage` drew "147 of 150 contacts" over an empty
  list area, and the source reads perfectly: the list states
  `Layout.fillHeight`, its parent states `Layout.fillHeight`, and the page's
  root column states it too. Only the numbers show that the column was never
  in a layout at all.
- `PagePlaceholder` centres its column in itself and clips nothing, so an
  empty state given a zero-height region paints its glyph OVER the search row
  above it. That is one symptom of the same cause, on the page whose list
  happens to be empty rather than full.
- an app icon that is never drawn, and one whose file failed to load, are the
  same source. Only `Image.status` tells them apart.
- a contact card sized from a constant fits one script. Arabic sets taller
  than Latin at the same `pixelSize`, so `Layout.preferredHeight: huge * 2` on
  the row's header drew the avatar flush on the card's bottom edge for a Latin
  name and pushed an Arabic contact's avatar and number out through the bottom
  of the card. An aligned layout child keeps its preferred size when the cell
  is too small - it overflows rather than shrinking - so nothing errors and
  nothing is logged. The fixture therefore carries both scripts.

It also drives the Android Apps page through every state it has, because which
message that page draws is a question about several facts at once and no source
check can ask it. Two families:

- what adb IS on this machine, which used to be one state and is three. `adb`
  is stripped out of the harness's PATH entirely (the maintainer's own lives in
  /opt/android-sdk/platform-tools), and the two stubs are copied in between
  steps: absent, then one that answers the way the dynamic loader does - the
  `error while loading shared libraries` sentence on stderr and exit 127 -
  then one that works. `command -v` reports the middle one as present, which
  is the whole defect: the webcam card read `ready`, the click did nothing, and
  the message pointed at the phone.
- what is ON adb: with no device the page must draw the pairing panel and
  NEITHER of the two lines that used to say the same thing beside it (a red
  "Phone not reachable over ADB" from the session manager, and a "No apps yet"
  empty state that cannot say what to do about it); with a phone that answered
  and had nothing, the empty state and no panel; with apps, the list and no
  message at all.

The pairing panel itself is driven end to end - discovery through a fake
`avahi-browse`, then `adb pair` and `adb connect` through the fake adb, whose
`connect` creates the attach marker so the panel is taken down by the phone
turning up under `adb devices` rather than by adb's own line (which is a claim:
the real `adb connect` exits 0 on a refused connection). It is measured at two
page widths, because a column pinned to one width passes every check at that
width.

The fake `busctl` serves one paired, reachable phone and two mirrored
notifications: leaf 70 carries an `iconPath` (a PNG this test writes, the way
kdeconnectd writes one per notification icon into its cache) and leaf 71
carries none, so both the icon and its fallback are on screen at once. The
Contacts page is fed by the REAL contacts monitor over a real
`kpeoplevcard/kdeconnect-<id>/` fixture tree, because a list with no rows
cannot answer "does a row draw at a real height".

Brings its own headless weston and its own session bus (`dbus-run-session`).
Skips when weston, qs or dbus-run-session are missing, as in CI.
