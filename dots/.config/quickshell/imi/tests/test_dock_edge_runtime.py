"""Drives the dock's pinned-app reorder with real mouse events, on both axes.

`DockEdgeRuntimeTest.qml` builds a real `DragApps` and drags its slots at a
horizontal edge and at a vertical one. This module is the driver: it stands up
a headless weston, points throwaway XDG dirs at it, and fails the suite on any
check the harness reports.

Why a runtime harness and not another source contract: a vertical dock's
failure mode is not a layout that looks wrong. `test_dock_position_contract.py`
can see that the reorder names an axis, and `tst_dock_geometry.qml` can see
that the geometry answers for four edges - neither can see whether a press and
a drag actually move an icon past its neighbour. The reorder used to compare x
everywhere, and in a column every slot centre has the same x: the comparison is
a number against itself, so the icons refuse to move past each other with
nothing in any log.

The discriminating pair is a drag ALONG the strip (must reorder) and a drag
ACROSS it (must not). The horizontal edge runs first as the control, because
"nothing happened" is what a harness that stopped delivering events reports.

What it cannot answer: the harness opens a FloatingWindow, and weston
implements no wlr-layer-shell, so the dock's anchors, exclusive zone, reveal
push and the compositor's inferred slide direction are all invisible to it -
along with everything that is a look rather than a behaviour. Those are
`hyprctl layers -j` plus `hyprctl monitors -j`, against the baseline recorded
in the design doc.

Skips when weston or qs is missing, as in CI.
