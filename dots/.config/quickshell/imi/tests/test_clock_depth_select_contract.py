"""The desktop subject selector's surface, its arming, and its verdicts.

Picking the wallpaper's subject moved off a ~300px thumbnail in the wallpaper
selector and onto the desktop, at full size, over the real widgets. Almost
nothing about that is reachable from a unit test - qmltestrunner cannot
construct a layer surface, weston implements no wlr-layer-shell, and the one
thing the mode is for is a human looking at pixels - so the parts that ARE
source text are pinned here.

What each group is guarding, and why the failure would otherwise be silent:

  - THE SURFACE. Its whole design is that it redraws nothing: the wallpaper is
    already on screen at the size and crop the click has to be measured
    against, and the widgets are already under it. An `Image` appearing in that
    file is a second copy of the picture, which is a second chance to be
    misaligned - and a misalignment here reads as the model having picked the
    wrong thing.
  - THE CONVERSION. A click arrives in screen coordinates and has to reach the
    producer as a point in the picture. It goes screen -> the box the
    background published -> the rectangle ClockDepthCutout publishes ->
    `normalisedPoint`, and every step of that already exists. A second
    derivation - recomputing the crop here, or reading `coverRect` - would be a
    registration nothing else uses, which is the exact failure ClockDepthCutout
    was extracted to make impossible.
  - THE ARMING. Entering, escaping, accepting, declining, and the ground moving
    underneath (the wallpaper switching, the desktop ceasing to show a still).
    Every one of these leaves either a surface over a desktop it no longer
    describes, or a verdict recorded against the wrong picture.
  - THE PICKER. It is the way IN and the record of state now, not the place a
    mask is authored. The gesture coming back to it is a regression, not a
    convenience.
