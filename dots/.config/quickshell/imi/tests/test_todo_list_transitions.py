"""The todo lists ride StyledListView's own transitions, on an identity-stable model.

docs/p3drovfx-animation-research-2026-08-16.md §4.7: we own a StyledListView
with the full positioner-transition vocabulary and use it in fewer places than
the sibling fork. The todo TaskList was the clearest case - it drew through
StyledListView and switched the transitions OFF (`animateAppearance: false`,
inherited from the fork ancestry, not a decision made here: the flag predates
this repo's history).

Turning the flag back on is half the fix, and the half a reviewer cannot see is
the model: Quickshell's ScriptModel diffs `values` by strict equality
(scriptmodel.cpp `a.strictlyEquals(b)` with no `objectProp` set), so
TodoWidget's old per-update wrapper - `.map(Object.assign({}, item,
{originalIndex: i}))` - handed it a list of brand-new objects on every change.
Every update then diffed as remove-all + add-all: with transitions off that was
silent delegate churn, with them on it would fly the entire list out and back
in when one task is marked done. The wrapper is gone; the filters pass
`Todo.list`'s own objects through (Todo mutates items in place and reassigns
the array, so identity survives a markDone/markUnfinished/delete), and the
delegate resolves an item's index at click time with `Todo.list.indexOf`,
which also cannot go stale across deletes the way a stored index could.

`animateMovement` stays at its default (off) deliberately: the diff emits
inserts and removes, never model moves, so the move/displaced slots have
nothing to fire on.

Why a source contract: qmltestrunner cannot construct Quickshell types, so
neither ScriptModel's diff nor a ListView transition is reachable from the QML
suite; the identity chain is exactly the part that reads correctly while
broken.
