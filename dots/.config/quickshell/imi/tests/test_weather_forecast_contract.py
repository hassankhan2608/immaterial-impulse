"""Weather forecast pins: the wiring the unit tests cannot see.

`tst_weather_forecast.qml` proves the day-grouping arithmetic and
`tst_weather_icons.qml` proves the provider-aware icon lookup, both against the
real sources. Neither can see the service that has to call them or the second
OpenWeatherMap request the forecast depends on, and each of those can break on
its own without failing a single unit test.

The URL pins are the load-bearing ones. `city` comes from config and from
shareable presets, and the existing calls carry a comment recording that they
were once spliced into a double-quoted `curl -s "${url}"` where `$()` and
backticks still expand. A new request built the old way would reopen that hole
in a file whose other three calls look correct.
