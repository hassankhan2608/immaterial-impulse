"""Frame mode, stage 1 (docs/proposals/frame-mode.md): off by default, one
geometry authority, and the surfaces that read it.

Pins: the config keys and their defaults; FrameGeometry is the only place
the insets are computed (ScreenCorners asks it for its margins, BarContent
asks it whether to square the plate, Frame draws the bands from it); the
family loads Frame only while the option is on; the bands reserve nothing and
