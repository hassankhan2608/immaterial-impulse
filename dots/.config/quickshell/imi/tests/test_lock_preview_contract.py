"""The lock screen's preview cannot authenticate, and the sweep proves it looked.

Spec §11.2's last bullet (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-16-edit-mode-design.md):
Edit Mode's Lockscreen tab renders the real lock islands inside the viewport,
so `LockSurface` gains a single switch - `interactive` - and everything that
could take a keystroke or dispatch a session action is gated on it. The other
half is `LockPreviewContext`: a second component satisfying `LockContext`'s
property surface whose unlock paths are empty and which constructs no
`PamContext` and runs no `fprintd-list`. "The preview context is the real one
with a flag" is how a preview ends up authenticating, which is why it is a
separate file this module can hold to a negative.

This is the one contract in the mode whose failure is a security bug rather
than a layout bug, so every sweep here asserts it still FOUND the thing it
swept - a grep that matches nothing must fail, not pass. Concretely:

- the click-handler sweep asserts how many handlers it found before judging
  them, so a rewrite that renames `onClicked` cannot leave the check green
  over nothing;
- the parity sweep asserts how many properties, signals and functions it
  extracted from `LockContext.qml`, so a parser miss reads as a failure;
- the negative sweeps (`PamContext`, `fprintd`, `Process`) sit beside a
  positive assertion that the preview file exists and declares the surface.
