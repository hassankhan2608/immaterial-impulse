"""Source contract: the Size row and the drag grip are one value.

A widget whose manifest offers more than one span already resizes by dragging
its corner. The grip is quick and it is also invisible until hovered, so the
same span is offered as a row in Settings > Widgets - discoverable, and
reachable from the keyboard.

What makes them one thing rather than two is that both read and write the
host's `__gridSize`, in `gridSizes.js`'s `"<cols>x<rows>"` form. A row writing
any other key, or the same key in another format, would be a second size the
widget does not have.

The gate is the other half. Not every widget is resizable: a widget qualifies
only when it has a design per size, so the row is *omitted* where the manifest
names one span, not shown disabled. A control that can never be enabled is
noise, and one that offers a span the widget has no layout for is worse than
no row at all.
