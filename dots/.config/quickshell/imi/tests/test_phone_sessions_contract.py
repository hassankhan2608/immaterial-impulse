"""Contract checks for the Phone tab's four session services:
services/PhoneDeps.qml, PhoneScrcpy.qml, PhoneCamera.qml, PhoneMic.qml.

The QML suite (tst_phone_scrcpy.qml) drives logic-only doubles under
tests/imports/testservices, so the doubles proving something transfers to
the real services only while the regions between the `BEGIN/END <name>
logic` markers are byte-for-byte identical - the first check here. The
rest pins the process I/O the doubles deliberately omit, which is the half
CONTRIBUTING.md names outright:

- every command is an argv array. The only shell strings are PhoneDeps'
  constant probes (`command -v <tool>` and the distro marker walk), with
  nothing interpolated into any of them;
- no Process in any of the four files carries a `running:` binding. The
  scrcpy supervisor is started imperatively, carries the restart-safe
  marker, and every restart goes through the backoff ladder; the
  capability probes start themselves from Component.onCompleted (the
  capability-probe lint's rule) and again from recheck();
- the supervisor's idle timer is declared at its ten seconds and consults
  managerWanted() before stopping anything;
- the DroidCam sessions are launched detached through droidcam_session.sh
  rather than held by a Process, and the microphone's default-sink swap is
  both persisted and undone on every exit path;
- the webcam PREVIEW is the opposite arrangement, deliberately: it is a
  Process the service owns, because `Quickshell.execDetached` returns no
  handle and a player nothing can stop sits frozen on a /dev/videoN that has
  stopped producing frames. Which endings actually reap it is
  tests/test_phone_preview_lifetime_runtime.py's question; this half pins that
  there is one player, one observer of the session, and no detached spawn.
