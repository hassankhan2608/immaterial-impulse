"""What Edit Mode may do to the desktop, and what it may not.

Stages 3 and 4 of docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-16-edit-mode-design.md: the
viewport and the desktop, plus the chrome surface's half of §11.2. The drawer,
the per-widget menu, the bar and the dock are later stages and are not here.

Five of these guard failures that are silent on screen:

- a second notion of "am I editing" (§11.2's one-predicate rule, the analogue of
  the dock's one-derivation lint) - four copies of a mode check is how three of
  them go stale;
- the mode written into the shrink instead of transformed into it: `scale` is a
  render-time transform precisely because x/y/width/height are what the
  parallax animates, what every clamp measures and what the frost samples, and
  folding a second meaning into them is what b710ef731 punished;
- something inside the viewport compensating for the viewport, which reads as
  correct at scale 1 and is wrong everywhere else;
- the mode WRITING the global widget lock rather than subtracting it, which
  destroys a stored preference and leaves the desktop unlocked afterwards;
- and the mid-drag exit committing rather than cancelling, which stores an
  unclamped overshoot - the defect 705e9006d fixed, where a real store held a
  widget at x: -852 on a 5120px screen.

The chrome surface adds three more of the same kind, none of which any harness
can see, because weston implements no wlr-layer-shell:

- a screen-sized surface whose input mask is not the chrome makes the desktop
  underneath unclickable, and the desktop underneath is the thing being edited;
- a namespace absent from rules.lua falls through the catch-all
  `ignore_alpha = 0.05`, under which that surface's transparent pixels ask the
  compositor to blur the whole screen;
- and a chrome surface taking keyboard focus sits in front of the background
  and swallows the Escape the exit ladder is answered on.

Four more came out of the first live load, and three of the four are silent in
the same way - they are geometry that is only wrong on a machine that has the
panel in question:

- two surfaces working out where the bar and the dock are separately, which
  frames a rectangle the desktop is not at, and only where the two derivations
  differ;
- a reservation that follows something which MOVES while the mode is on
  (auto-hide, a hover reveal, a fullscreen window), which resizes the viewport
  mid-edit - b710ef731's defect reached from a new direction;
- the chrome placed against the screen's own edges rather than against the
  usable area, which is what put the toolbar on the bar's widgets;
- and a tone drawn between the specular and the inner highlight, which turns
  the card's bevel into a bevel around a line.

The card's edge then came back a third time, as a whole-card judgement no
per-tone measurement had asked: three defensible tones summed to five drawn
pixels of piping at one strength round the whole perimeter, which is a border.
Two rules hold the replacement in place - nothing may be drawn INSIDE the card
(anything there misses `surround`'s mask and is a uniform line by construction),
and the one band outside it is one pixel wide with a flank a fraction of its
top, not merely less than it.
