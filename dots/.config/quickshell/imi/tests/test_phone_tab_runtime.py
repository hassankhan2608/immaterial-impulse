"""The Phone tab, driven against a fake daemon in a real shell.

`PhoneTabRuntimeTest.qml` builds the real Phone tab over the real
`services/PhoneConnect.qml`, with a fake `busctl` on PATH exposing two
devices: a paired, reachable phone (battery, address, LTE report) and an
unpaired laptop whose pairState says the peer asked. The harness reads the
surface back - the chip, the pills in their priority order, one row of six
actions and which of them answer, the two navigation cards, the sub-page
overlay degrading to nothing while the other workstream's pages are absent,
the notification list owning the leftover height (measured: take the pairing
card away and the list grows by exactly that card), the pairing card and the
roster behind the chip's arrow - and clicks Accept and Decline.

It also puts a fake `adb`, `scrcpy`, `droidcam-cli`, `pactl`, `v4l2-ctl`,
`lsmod`, `modinfo` and `mpv` on PATH, so `PhoneDeps` answers the same way on
every machine instead of reading the developer's own. The fake `adb` lists NO
device - the machine this was written against, where KDE Connect reaches the
phone over LAN and adb has never seen it - which is what puts the mirror and
the microphone cards on their "no device over ADB" state before anything is
clicked. The footer's geometry and the feature cards' click path are read
back here because neither is reachable from `qmltestrunner`: it can build
neither a laid-out box nor a RippleButton, which is why the cards' own
decisions live in `phone_cards.js` and are driven by `tests/tst_phone_cards.qml`.

Those two clicks are scored HERE, off the fake's recorded invocations:
`acceptPairing` and `cancelPairing` must each have been called once, on the
laptop's device path, and never on the phone's. A click that reached nothing
would leave the harness green (a button is a button) and this red.

The mirror card's click is driven all the way through the real supervisor -
the fake `scrcpy` on PATH exits 1 with "Could not find any ADB device", which
is what a real one does with no phone attached - and the harness watches the
card frame by frame across it. That is the only place the three defects this
harness grew for are visible: a card that reads "running" between the spawn
and the exit, a badge whose glyph fades to nothing inside a shape that does
not, and a failed launch that snaps back to the line it started on. The
sub-page cross-fade and the toast's width are watched the same way, each with
a control, since a settled reading is identical whether or not anything moved.

So is the footer's clear action, which carries the one glyph on that bar whose
text ever changes: the count is driven through `PhoneNotifications` and the
swap sampled in both axes and in opacity, because a deferred text swap on a
Control's content item lands the glyph on the padded rect's corner and leaves
it there - a reading taken before the first change agrees with itself either
way.

Brings its own headless weston and its own session bus (`dbus-run-session`).
Skips when weston, qs or dbus-run-session are missing, as in CI.
