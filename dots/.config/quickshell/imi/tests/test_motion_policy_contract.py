"""One motion policy, reached through one door.

`modules/common/motion_policy.js` decides three things - how a catalogued
duration is scaled, where the reduce-motion floor is, and how a group of things
arrives in sequence. `tests/tst_motion_policy.qml` pins the arithmetic and
`tests/test_motion_multiplier_runtime.py` pins that the shell really reads it.
What is left, and what this file holds, is the part that decays quietly: that
every tier still goes through it, that the module stays pure enough to be
testable at all, and that a cascade written next year does not spell its own
`index * 40` beside the one that does not.

The failure this guards against is the surveyed fork's, restated: it HAS an
animation multiplier, and roughly half its shell does not see it, because the
value of a knob is exactly the proportion of the tree that routes through it -
and that proportion only ever decays.

# slow. There's a frame drop the moment it opens and the moment it closes."
# Two properties of THIS surface are why, and neither is a tuning. Its
# container is a layer surface the compositor slides, so there is no progress
# to gate on and the head start can only be a guessed `leadIn` - which put the
# last member's landing 180ms past the end of `sidebarSlideEnter`. And the
# surface is DESTROYED by the gesture the wave rides: `PanelWindow.visible`
# follows the open state, layer-shell forbids window reuse, so the wave's
# frames land on a surface the compositor is still bringing up and its exit
# animates a window that has already been asked to leave - measured at a median
# of 30 rendered frames per open against 5 without it, and 13 per close against
# zero. The frame drop the report names is that teardown-and-rebuild and NOT
# the wave; see AGENT.md's design-language section, which carries the numbers
# and the two suspects they eliminate. Re-adopting is a decision to be argued,
