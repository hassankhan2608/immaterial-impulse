"""One motion policy, reached through one door.

`modules/common/motion_policy.js` decides three things - how a catalogued
duration is scaled, where the reduce-motion floor is, and how a group of things
arrives in sequence. `tests/tst_motion_policy.qml` pins the arithmetic and
`tests/test_motion_multiplier_runtime.py` pins that the shell really reads it.
What is left, and what this file holds, is the part that decays quietly: that
every tier still goes through it, that the module stays pure enough to be
testable at all, and that a cascade written next year does not spell its own
`index * 40` beside the one that does not.

The failure this guards against is the surveyed fork's, restated: it HAS an
animation multiplier, and roughly half its shell does not see it, because the
value of a knob is exactly the proportion of the tree that routes through it -
and that proportion only ever decays.
