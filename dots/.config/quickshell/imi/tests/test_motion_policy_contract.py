"""One motion policy, reached through one door.

`modules/common/motion_policy.js` decides three things - how a catalogued
duration is scaled, where the reduce-motion floor is, and how a group of things
arrives in sequence. `tests/tst_motion_policy.qml` pins the arithmetic and
`tests/test_motion_multiplier_runtime.py` pins that the shell really reads it.
What is left, and what this file holds, is the part that decays quietly: that
every tier still goes through it, that the module stays pure enough to be
testable at all, and that a cascade written next year does not spell its own
`index * 40` beside the one that does not.

The failure this guards against is the surveyed fork's, restated: it HAS an
animation multiplier, and roughly half its shell does not see it, because the
value of a knob is exactly the proportion of the tree that routes through it -
and that proportion only ever decays.

# The other half of that ratchet: a surface that adopted a wave, was judged on

# the next agent reads "a group arrives in sequence" in the guidelines, sees a
# column of independent cards, and re-adopts the one surface where that was
# tried and refused. A refusal is invisible in the source, exactly like the
# adoption it mirrors.
#
# The right sidebar is the worked example of the register running in BOTH
# directions, and its history is the argument for keeping refusals written
# down. 9e10b8a9c ("feat(sidebar): the right sidebar's sections arrive in
# sequence") gave it a wave; the maintainer rejected it on screen ("feels
# slow", a frame drop at both ends) and 00efe588 took it off, with two
# measured facts recorded here: the container was a compositor-slid surface
# with no progress to gate on (so the head start was a guessed leadIn landing
# the last member ~200ms after the slide), and the surface was destroyed per
# gesture, which was the frame drop. BOTH facts were later repaired for
# unrelated reasons - the sidebar became a persistent surface whose EdgeSlide
# owns the slide in-client - so when the maintainer asked for the cascade
# again (2026-08-24), re-adoption was argued on the repairs, not copied:
# the wave first gated on the EdgeSlide's scalar - and that version was
# measured as ruined (the panel arrived empty and built itself on stage).
# The design that stuck runs UNGATED under the slide, park-and-enter on the
# open's rising edge, behind EdgeSlide's `reveal` curtain (d59440244, "fix(motion): the entrance runs under the slide - the panel materializes composed").
# It is in STAGGER_ADOPTERS above; this note stays because the register's
# job is exactly this round trip.

    # Dialog content. Assessed for the group entrance when the desktop menu
    # adopted it and refused on the surface's own facts, all of them readable
    # in the tree rather than guessed:
    #
    #  - A dialog's content is the question being asked. Every WindowDialog
    #    here is an interruption offering a decision (the polkit auth prompt,
    #    the uninstall confirm, the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/Tailscale/volume/phone
    #    dialogs), and a clamped five-rank wave puts the last member's landing
    #    ~400ms after the gate - latency on exactly the thing the user was
    #    interrupted to read. This is the launcher refusal's argument on a
    #    modal surface: a wave is wrong where the content IS what is being
    #    waited for.
    #  - The polkit prompt `forceActiveFocus()`es its field the moment it
    #    opens (PolkitContent.qml) and users answer immediately; a cascade
    #    puts keystrokes into a password field still parked at `appear: 0`,
    #    invisible, on an authentication surface.
    #  - The card already has an entrance of its own that members would fight:
    #    `onShowChanged` freezes the card's height at the show flip (the
    #    binding-destroying assignment AGENT.md documents as load-bearing) and
    #    the card unfolds 0 -> that height while the content column fades AS
    #    ONE - a per-member cascade inside an unfolding card is two entrances
    #    stacked on one surface.
    #  - Six of the dialog content files bleed children to the card's edge
    #    with negative `contentPadding` margins (separators, lists); a
    #    scale-and-rise dressing on those members swings edge-to-edge chrome
    #    onto the scrim mid-entrance, and separators would spend wave slots.
    #  - The dialog surfaces are created by the gesture that opens them (the
    #    sidebar's `toggleDialogLoader.active` flips on `shown`;
    #    FullscreenPolkitWindow is gated on `PolkitService.active`), which is
    #    the measured half of the sidebar refusal above: wave frames landing
    #    on a surface the compositor is still bringing up.

    # A dialog that someday earns a group entrance argues these down first -
    # in particular the first two, which are properties of what a dialog IS
    # rather than of how this one is built.
