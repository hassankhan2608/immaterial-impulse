The composition this pins lives in QML property bindings across `WidgetCanvas`,
`AbstractWidget`, `AbstractBackgroundWidget` and `PluginWidget` - none of it
instantiable by the qmltestrunner suite, because the host needs Quickshell's
types and a real canvas parent. `WidgetGroupDragRuntimeTest.qml` builds the
real thing under `qs -p` and is the behavioural half; these are the greppable
pins that run in CI.
