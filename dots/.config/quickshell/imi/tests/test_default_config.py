    """What a *fresh* install ends up with on its desktop.

    Every desktop widget is a bundled plugin now, so nothing reads
    `background.widgets.*` at runtime any more - but the file is still the
    input to `Config.migrateDesktopWidgetsToPlugins()`, which runs on the very
    first load of the seeded config and turns those `enable` bits into
    `plugins.enabled`. That makes the block look like dead legacy state while
    it is in fact the only thing deciding what a new user sees.

    The trap is that a `JsonAdapter` falls back to the QML-declared default for
    any key the file omits (verified against a live Quickshell instance:
    a file with no `clock` object at all still reads `clock.enable === true`).
    So deleting a block does not mean "off" - it means "whatever `Config.qml`
    says", which is `true` for the clock and `false` for the calendar and the
    visualizer. Tidying the whole block away would therefore have silently
    stripped the visualizer, and leaving a `calendar` block in would ship a
    widget the curated desktop does not want.

    The shipped desktop is the clock and the visualizer. Both sit at an edge -
    the clock centred, the visualizer full-bleed along the bottom - so neither
    claims a tile a new user has not chosen to give it. The calendar does claim
    one, which is why it ships off.
