"""Night light on/off state, against a real shell and a fake hyprsunset.

hyprsunset has no state query. On 0.4.0 `hyprctl hyprsunset --help` lists three
requests - `temperature`, `gamma`, `identity` - and the daemon socket answers
"invalid command" to `state`, `status`, `info`, `enabled`, `active`, `matrix`.
The bare `temperature` request reports the last temperature the daemon was
*told*; `identity`, the off switch, never resets it. Measured: a daemon running
as `hyprsunset --identity` (neutral screen) reports 6000, and a daemon put into
identity after `temperature 5000` still reports 5000.

`services/Hyprsunset.qml` used to infer on/off from that query by comparing it
against a hardcoded `"6500"` - the *slider's* neutral end in NightLightDialog,
not anything hyprsunset knows about - so `temperatureActive` was true whenever
the last-set temperature was not literally 6500, including with the identity
matrix applied and the screen perfectly neutral. The indicator and the toggle
could then disagree with the display.

So the state is the shell's, persisted in states.json and re-applied at startup.
These cases pin both halves: what the shell comes up believing, and what it
actually tells the daemon to do about it.

Fake `hyprsunset`, `hyprctl` and `pidof` executables go at the front of PATH and
record their argv. `pidof` is the load-bearing one: `startHyprsunset` runs
`pidof hyprsunset || hyprsunset ...`, so on any machine with a live daemon the
launch path is skipped entirely and an assertion about launch flags passes
without ever running. Faking it makes cold start and warm start both reachable,
on purpose, in the same suite.

Brings its own headless weston, so it needs no display of its own. Skips when
weston or qs is missing, as in CI.
