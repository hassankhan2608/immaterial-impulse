"""The config-directory migration against a real, running shell.

`test_config_migration.py` drives `scripts/migrate-config-dir.sh` on its own.
It cannot see the failure this module exists for: the script used to be fired
with `Quickshell.execDetached`, which returns immediately, so it ran
concurrently with `Config`'s asynchronous `FileView` load. When `Config` got
there first it wrote a default `config.json` into the destination, the script's
guard then saw that file, and the whole directory migration was skipped - a
user arriving from upstream silently kept none of their settings.

Nothing about that is observable from the script, and "it happened to win every
probe run" is not a fix. So the interleaving is forced instead: `IMI_MIGRATE_DELAY`
holds the script open for seconds, which is long enough that a `Config` load
racing it wins every single time. `ConfigDirMigrationRuntimeTest.qml` samples
`Directories.configDirReady` at the instant `Config.ready` turns true and fails
if the migration had not already finished.

Brings its own headless weston, so it needs no display of its own - a real
`qs` process needs a compositor even with no windows on screen, and running it
on the caller's session is not worth the risk for a test that migrates config
directories. Skips when weston or qs is missing, as in CI.
