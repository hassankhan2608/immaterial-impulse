"""The left sidebar's tab set, pinned.

`SidebarLeftContent.qml` holds the tabs as parallel literal arrays that
have to stay index-aligned by hand: the tab-bar entries (`tabButtonList`),
the untranslated ids a deep link resolves against (`tabIdList`), and the
SwipeView's `contentChildren`. There is no registry behind them, so a tab
added on one side alone shows the WRONG PAGE - silently, because every
index is still a valid index. That is a class of bug nothing else in the
suite can see: the QML tests never build these widgets, and a mis-aligned
SwipeView renders perfectly.

Two asymmetries make the alignment fragile enough to be worth a check
rather than a comment. The placeholder page sits between the last real tab
and Anime with NO tab-bar entry of its own, and closet mode
(`policies.weeb === 2`) puts an Anime PAGE in the SwipeView with no entry
either - so the two lists are legitimately different lengths, and only the
entries before the placeholder are aligned. A reader who "fixes" that by
adding a placeholder entry, or who appends a new tab after Anime, breaks
the alignment in a way that reads correctly.

Shaped after `tests/test_edit_mode_contract.py`'s tab-list check, which is
the only other place in the tree that pins a tab set.
