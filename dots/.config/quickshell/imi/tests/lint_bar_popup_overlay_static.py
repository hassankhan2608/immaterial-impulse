"""The bar popup overlay's surface geometry must be a constant of the screen.

`modules/imi/bar/BarPopupOverlay.qml` hosts every bar popup's card on one
layer surface. That only works while the *surface* never moves or resizes: on a
layer-shell surface position is `margins`, so a bound margin, a bound implicit
size, or an edge anchor that can go false reconfigures the surface - which is
the create-map-destroy loop StyledPopup's imperative positioning was written to
escape, reached from the other side.

The surface is no longer always MAPPED - it unmaps while it has nothing to
show, because a mapped screen-sized Overlay surface holds the compositor's
fullscreen fast path shut - and that added a rule of its own. A WlrLayershell
window that has just gone visible does not have its size yet: measured on the
live compositor, 500x500 for the same tick and through Qt.callLater, the real
size arriving with the configure ~50ms later. `retarget()` clamps the card
against the window's width/height, so a retarget on the zero-interval timer
alone pinned the card to the top-left margin - the calendar under the clock at
screen-centre. The overlay must therefore retarget again when its own geometry
lands (`onWidthChanged`/`onHeightChanged`), which is the last check below.

Two more properties this file must keep, both from the same design:

  - the mask tracks x/y/width/height and *not* transforms, so the morph and the
    exit may never be expressed as `scale` or `rotation` (quickshell
    src/core/region.cpp connects only the four geometry signals);
  - the card must collapse to 0x0 when idle, because an `opacity: 0` card still
    publishes a full-size input region and would eat every click in its
    rectangle for the rest of the session.

Run from `tests/run_tests.sh`. Prove it can fail by planting one of the banned
forms in a clean tree.
