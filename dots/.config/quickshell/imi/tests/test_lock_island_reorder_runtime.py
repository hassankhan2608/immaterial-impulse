"""Drives the lock islands' reorder with real mouse events.

`LockIslandReorderRuntimeTest.qml` builds the REAL `LockSurface` with the real
`LockPreviewContext` and drags its slots, committing against the real
`Config.options.lock.islands.*` lists in a throwaway config. What only real
events can show: the press lands on the overlay's eater and `ReorderDragArea`
takes over past the threshold; the drop resolves over centres carrying holes
(invisible slots, the dragged one); the commit runs move semantics and the
`storedOrder` merge, so an id a newer shell stored survives; the password slot
loads no overlay and the same gesture over it moves nothing; and both cancel
paths - the ladder's `editReorderCancel` and the mode's exit - leave the
stored lists untouched.

Headless weston because the harness opens a window; weston implements no
wlr-layer-shell, so the real session lock surface is outside what this can
say.

A PRIVATE session bus, for the same reason the runtime dir is private: the
left island's `username` and `keyboardLayout` slots hide while a media player
is registered (`LockSurface.islandItemVisible`), so on the user's own session
bus a browser holding an MPRIS name makes both invisible and the drag lands on
nothing - the test then passes or fails on whether a tab was playing. Skips
when weston, qs or dbus-run-session is missing, as in CI.
