"""Does the depth layer put the wallpaper over the clock, and follow the pan?

The layer is a fourth sibling of the wallpaper viewport that reconstructs the
pan by hand, and both halves of that are invisible everywhere else: source text
cannot show whether the mask lands on the pixels it was cut from, and
qmltestrunner draws no layer effect, so nothing but a rendered frame can answer
it. lint_clock_depth_geometry.py pins the declaration; this pins what it draws.

The mask is synthetic - a half-white 1024x1024 square over a flat wallpaper -
so no model runs here and no judgement about any mask's quality is involved.

The pan assertion is the reason this exists at all. A layer bound to the pan's
DESTINATION instead of to the viewport's live x settles in exactly the right
place, so every settled check passes on it; only a frame taken while the 600ms
animation is running can tell the two apart.
