/**
 * The weather popup with an hourly row in it, measured where the card can see
 * it.
 *
 * Two separate things are checked, and neither is reachable from a unit test.
 *
 * The first is the HERO. `BarPopupOverlay` opens the card at the height of the
 * content's first DRAWN section and unfurls from there, so adding a section to
 * a popup changes what that measurement returns unless the section lands after
 * the hero - and `heroSectionHeight` skips undrawn and zero-height children, so
 * "after the hero" is a fact about the built tree rather than about the source.
 * A row that became the hero would open the card as a 60px strip with the
 * temperature and the city below the fold.
 *
 * The second is the GROWTH. The bars grow from the axis on `charted`, which is
 * the popup's own visibility, so the motion plays on a refresh as well as on an
 * open - the tree this was taken from writes the heights from a NumberAnimation
 * that destroys the binding, so its chart animates on open and never on data
 * (docs/p3drovfx-animation-research-2026-08-16.md §3.3). A settled height is
 * the same number whether it animated or teleported, so every growth check
 * samples the bars in flight.
 *
 * Driven by tests/test_weather_popup_hero_runtime.py under headless weston and
 * its own bus. Nothing here needs a layer surface: the content is parented into
 * an ordinary window, which is what the overlay does to it anyway.
