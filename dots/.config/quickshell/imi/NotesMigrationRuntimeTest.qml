/**
 * Drives services/Notes.qml's real migration against real files.
 *
 * tests/tst_notes_store.qml covers every shape the two stores can be in, but
 * it calls pure functions - it cannot see the part that actually decides
 * whether a user keeps their notes: two asynchronous FileView loads plus an
 * asynchronous Config load, all three of which have to be in hand before
 * anything is written, and a marker that must be set exactly once.
 *
 * Launched once per case by tests/test_notes_migration_runtime.py, which seeds
 * a throwaway XDG_STATE_HOME/XDG_CONFIG_HOME, passes the expected note bodies
 * in NOTES_EXPECT, and checks the files afterwards. Never point it at a real
 * state directory - it writes the note store.
 *
 *   NOTES_EXPECT='["a","b"]' XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$(mktemp -d) \
 *     XDG_STATE_HOME=$(mktemp -d) qs -p NotesMigrationRuntimeTest.qml
