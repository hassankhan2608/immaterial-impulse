/**
 * Builds the REAL Phone tab over the REAL services/PhoneConnect.qml, fed
 * by a fake `busctl` on PATH, and reads the surface back: which device the
 * chip names, what the pills say, how many action buttons there are and
 * which of them answer, which child of the column owns the leftover
 * height, what the pairing card does when its two buttons are clicked, and
 * that the sub-page overlay degrades to nothing while the other
 * workstream's pages are absent.
 *
 * Driven by tests/test_phone_tab_runtime.py, which reads the fake's
 * recorded invocations afterwards: the two pairing clicks are scored
 * there, as `acceptPairing`/`cancelPairing` argv aimed at the device that
 * asked and never at the paired phone.
 *
 * The fake daemon exposes two devices - a paired, reachable phone with a
 * battery, an address and an LTE report, and an unpaired laptop whose
 * pairState says the peer asked (2) and which has no battery or report
 * leaf at all - so every branch of the surface is on screen at once.
 *
 * The driver also puts a fake `adb`, `scrcpy`, `droidcam-cli`, `pactl`,
 * `v4l2-ctl`, `lsmod`, `modinfo` and `mpv` on PATH, so PhoneDeps answers the
 * same way on every machine and the three feature cards are in a state other
 * than `unavailable`. The fake `adb` lists NO device, which is the machine
 * this branch was written against: KDE Connect reaches the phone over LAN and
 * adb has never seen it. What is read back here is the click PATH and the
 * card GEOMETRY, neither of which is reachable from qmltestrunner - the
 * decisions themselves live in phone_cards.js and are driven by
 * tests/tst_phone_cards.qml.
 *
 * Five things here are WATCHED rather than read once, because each of them
 * is a defect that only exists between two settled states:
 *
 *  - the mirror launch. `Directories.scriptPath` resolves to this checkout,
 *    so the click really starts scripts/phone/scrcpy_session_manager.py,
 *    which really spawns the fake scrcpy, which exits 1 the way the real one
 *    does with no phone on adb. `launchWatch` samples every 25ms and the step
 *    after it asserts that the card was NEVER read as running or active -
 *    the supervisor's `started` means "spawned" - that the badge's glyph
 *    never blanked, and that what the card settles on is the error rather
 *    than the line it was already showing before the click;
 *  - the sub-page cross-fade. `fadeWatch` samples the outgoing column's
 *    opacity and scale, and the check that matters is that a MID-flight
 *    reading exists: every "was it ever out of range" assertion passes
 *    identically on a transition that never ran;
 *  - the roster's reveal, in both directions. `rosterWatch` samples the box
 *    that uncovers the device list, and what is asserted is that a MID-flight
 *    height exists: a reveal that never ran and one that completed in a frame
 *    settle on the same number;
 *  - the footer's clear action, across the one glyph swap this bar has. A
 *    deferred text swap on a Control's content item lands the glyph on the
 *    padded rect's corner rather than on its centre and leaves it there, so
 *    the reading taken before the count first moves is identical whether or
 *    not the rest of the session is drawn off centre. `swapWatch` samples
 *    both axes and the glyph's opacity across it;
 *  - the toast's width, against a control. A short message must produce a
 *    toast narrower than the cap before a long one is allowed to prove the
 *    cap holds.
