# Every local PKGBUILD below is built with makepkg, so the full base-devel
# toolchain has to be present *before* the first build - including the members
# that are easy to be missing. `base-devel` used to be a pacman *group*: someone
# who ran `pacman -S base-devel` years ago got a snapshot of its members at that
# time and never received the ones added later, because group members are not
# retroactively pulled in. `debugedit` is exactly such a latecomer.
#
# That bites even though nothing here builds debug packages. makepkg's
# check_software() runs executable_debugedit() as a *precondition*, gated only on
# `check_option "debug" "y"` - so on a makepkg.conf with `debug` enabled (not the
# Arch default, but what a merged .pacnew or a hand-tuned config often ends up
# with), a missing debugedit aborts the very first `makepkg` call with
# "Cannot find the debugedit binary required for including source files in debug
# packages" - before a single line is compiled, and even for the meta packages
# that build nothing at all.
#
# We only ensured base-devel inside install-yay(), which is skipped entirely when
# yay is already installed - so the users most likely to be missing a latecomer
# (long-lived installs) were exactly the ones we never fixed it for.
