# 4.wallpaperengine.sh — OPTIONAL. Builds the patched Quickshell (carrying the
# Quickshell.WallpaperEngine module) + linux-wallpaperengine, and installs it so
# `qs`/`quickshell` on PATH is the WE-capable build. No-op unless INSTALL_WE=1.
#
# Unlike the other numbered subcmd-install/*.sh steps, this one is meant to be
# RUN (`bash 4.wallpaperengine.sh`), not sourced: it's self-contained and uses
# `exit 0` for the skip path, which would blow up the caller if sourced.
#
# What this does, and why, per XephyLon/qs-wallpaperengine (read at
# implementation time, see ~/dev/qs-wallpaperengine README.md/bootstrap.sh/
# launch-shell.sh):
#   - bootstrap.sh only clones+patches the two upstreams (linux-wallpaperengine
#     and Quickshell) and prints the cmake invocations as COMMENTS for manual
#     iteration ("Status: Scaffold only") — it does not build anything itself.
#     So this script runs those documented cmake steps itself.
#   - The actual working Quickshell build directory (confirmed against
#     launch-shell.sh, the real runtime launcher) is `build2`, not the `build`
#     dir bootstrap.sh's comments name — a fresh configure-with-all-flags-on
#     dir was needed after toggling service plugins broke an existing one
#     (see bootstrap.sh's own comment on this).
#   - linux-wallpaperengine's build additionally bundles a handful of runtime
#     libs (its own libEGL/libGLESv2, CEF/libcef, libvk_swiftshader) into its
#     `build/output` directory alongside liblinux-wallpaperengine-lib.so.
#     `launch-shell.sh` shows the patched quickshell binary needs all of that
#     on LD_LIBRARY_PATH to run: `build/linux-wallpaperengine/build/output`,
#     plus `/opt/linux-wallpaperengine/lib` and `/opt/linux-wallpaperengine`
#     (the system linux-wallpaperengine-git package's install dirs).
#   - The built binary carries a RUNPATH to that output dir, so it resolves
#     those libs unaided. We still install a small wrapper at
#     /usr/local/bin/quickshell (it execs the real binary in the cache build
#     dir and sets the Qt render loop), plus a `qs` symlink to it. The wrapper
#     deliberately does NOT export LD_LIBRARY_PATH: it is inherited by every
#     app the shell launches, and those dirs carry CEF's own libEGL/libGLESv2,
#     which shadowed the system ones and crashed Firefox at startup. /usr/local/bin is first on PATH ahead of
#     /usr/bin on virtually every distro, so this shadows the distro package's
#     `qs`/`quickshell` (e.g. immaterial-impulse-quickshell-git) without ever
#     touching a package-manager-owned file.
