# The loop above deploys dots/.config/* with rsync --delete, and the SDDM login
# theme keeps its integration *inside* one of those files: its installer appends
# a `[templates.iisddmtheme]` block to ~/.config/matugen/config.toml so the
# greeter's colors are regenerated on every wallpaper change. We ship our own
# config.toml without that block, so each update deleted it and the login screen
# quietly froze at whatever it looked like when the theme was installed.
#
# The block is one unit and has to be restored as one. An earlier version of
# this function put back only the `post_hook`, under [config] rather than under
# the template, which is worse than not restoring anything: the hook fires (now
# after *every* matugen run, not just this template's) while the input_path /
# output_path pair that actually regenerates Colors.qml is gone, so nothing is
# produced for it to publish. The greeter's palette stayed frozen and the
# function reported success. See issue #101.
#
# Idempotent, and it re-derives the mode rather than assuming:
# generate_settings.py is only present for the ii+matugen mode, which
# additionally syncs the shell's own settings.
