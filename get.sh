#
#   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XephyLon/immaterial-impulse/main/get.sh)
#
# Use the `bash <(curl ...)` form, NOT `curl ... | bash`: the installer is
# interactive (whiptail menu), and piping the script into bash would occupy
# stdin and break the prompts.
#
# The suite installer (`setup` + `sdata/`) needs the full repository tree, so
# this just clones it (to a stable location, reused for updates) and hands off.
#
# Overridable via env: IMI_REPO, IMI_REF (branch/tag/commit), IMI_DEST.
